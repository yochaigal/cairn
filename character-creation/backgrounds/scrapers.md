# Scrapers

> Drawn towards the ruins, away from the humming, raucous cities, [Scrappers](https://degenesis.com/world/cults/scrappers) dig in the dust and dirt. Every cut of the spade brings them closer to the era of the ancient people. They work tirelessly, digging all the way down until they can drag technical wonders caked with soot into the light of day.

| **7** | **Cave Bear**                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **The Mob**: Scrappers face relentless abuse from other Cults, but when pushed too far, they unleash their fury, rallying the masses with their impassioned outcry. Their anger ignites a collective uprising, and the Scrapper takes control, directing the mob with decisive commands.                                                                |
| **2** | **Rat**: Scrappers excel at staying out of trouble, blending into the crowd and pulling off daring acts without getting caught. Rats among them thrive in chaos, skillfully shifting blame to others while slipping away with their loot unnoticed. They always appear innocent, with no one able to prove otherwise.                                   |
| **3** | **Tough Dog**: Tough Dogs endure abuse and taunts, defiantly challenging their tormentors with, "Is that all you’ve got?" They rely on their resilience, outlasting their enemies until they tire. Their hardened nature makes them tougher than most. When you roll **HP**, roll one additional die and remove the lowest.                             |
| **4** | **Nitro**: Nitros have unearthed a deep-seated rage against the fear that once held them back. This hidden fury erupts when provoked, turning the Scrapper into a force of explosive anger against those who underestimate them. Your first attack in combat is **Enhanced**.                                                                           |
| **5** | **Truffle Pig**: Skilled Scrappers have an uncanny knack for uncovering valuable artifacts, leaving the Chroniclers eager to pay up. Those without this talent struggle to find anything beyond basic scrap. Scrappers with the "Truffle Pig" instinct seem to naturally sense hidden treasures and dangers in the ruins.                               |
| **6** | **Darwin**: In the brutal depths of the ruins, only the strongest survive, and the Darwins are the best of them. Through luck or extraordinary feats, they escape even the direst situations. A Darwin is a master of survival, known for defying the odds and emerging from seemingly hopeless scenarios. Recover 1d6 **HP** when you gain a **Scar**. |
