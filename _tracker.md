Add to config: nav_external_links_new_tab: true
Backgrounds and monsters are external links. Degenesis clans are backgrounds.


With backgrounds (skills) the consequence of a failed save are milder, and successes are greater. See this [summary](https://dreamingdragonslayer.wordpress.com/2020/03/28/advantage-and-impact/).
Skills are treated like WuDu or as a dice of different size from 24xx
