# Localization Guide

Although the Cairn rules exist in many forms (PDF, Google Docs, Word, etc), the SRD is probably the best choice for ease of translation. The entire SRD for both first and second editions of Cairn can be found in the Github [repository](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn/).

## Translating the SRD

1. Copy the [SRD](https://github.com/yochaigal/cairn/) to a markdown editor such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or a web-based renderer like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io). If you know how to use Git, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you don't know markdown, don't worry! It's easy. Read more [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

2. Do the hard work of translating the core document. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) and [deepl.com](https://deepl.com) are good resources; you can even simply translate the entire document once, then look through it for corrections.

## Optional: Create a language-specific version of this website!
1. Follow the steps [here](/hacks/fork-this) to get started in forking this repo.

2. Be sure to name the repo cairn-**lang**, e.g. cairn-fr for French, etc. Your repo should be called something like https://github.com/yourusername/cairn-lang.

3. Copy the translated markdown into the cairn-srd.md file.

4. Translate the other pages in the repo (readme, resources, etc).

5. When building the Affinity files, add "**Lang** Version" to the cover.

6. If you would like a subdomain (e.g. lan.cairnrpg.com) let Yochai know and follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) guide.
