## Design philosophies

#### Neutrality
The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.  

#### Classless
A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.  

#### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.  

#### Fiction First
Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.  

#### Growth
Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
#### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.  

#### Principles
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.  

#### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.
