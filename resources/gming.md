# Running a Game

Terra is intended to be sandbox.
Pre-game preparation is minimal, and generation can occur during gameplay.
The suggested approach is adapted from the [Lazy GM SRD](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_gm_resource_document.html).

## Prep Steps 

- [ ] Review notes, think of world reacting back
- [ ] Evaluate faction turn (i.e. the dynamic plot)
- [ ] Define **Start**
- [ ] Define **Scenes**
- [ ] Define **Info**
- [ ] Define **Locations**
- [ ] Define **People**
- [ ] Define **Creatures**
- [ ] Prepare maps
- [ ] Prepare names
