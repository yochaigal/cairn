## Visitors

### Lazarus Rabbit

When first encountered, the rabbit has an arrow sticking out of its side (having been killed by an arrow once already) This cursed creature, if left unchecked, is capable of eventually destroying the world. Banishment from this reality, a wish spell, or creative long- term imprisonment is likely the best option._

2 HP, 4 STR, 9 DEX, 11 WIL, bite (1d4)
- Effectively immortal. If the rabbit is killed, it will come back to life after 10 minutes +1 HP, and a more powerful bite (e.g. 1d6).

### "Limbs"
_This creature resembles a dense bouquet of 20+ human arms suspended on two elongated arms that serve as legs. Limbs’ compulsion is to disassemble.

It does not understand the concept of death and will not easily understand why its actions are harmful._  

7 HP, 12 STR, 11 DEX, 16 WIL  
- A dozen curious hands disassembling your living body (1d8)  
- Effectively immortal. Switches to an incorporeal state and slowly regains its physical form at a rate of 1 STR/day. Injuring “**Limbs**” will eventually disable its arms.

### "Mermaid"
_“Mermaid” looks vaguely human with a perfectly round face, a permanent smile, and no nose. It’s body glows with an intense radioactive green light and her arms extend to any length. Mermaid’s compulsion is to effectively caress everything within arm’s length. It will hold any creature or object close to it, eventually crushing it to death in an endlessly expanding mass of detritus. Like **Limbs**,_ _It does not understand the concept of death and will not easily understand why its actions are harmful. It has human- like legs but prefers the cool of the water._

12 HP, 16 STR, 5 DEX, 1 WIL, Extremely large, crushing arms that want to hug but don’t know their own strength (1d8)

### “Spoons”
_Effectively immortal. Switches to an incorporeal state and slowly regains its physical form at a rate of 1 STR/day. Attacking “Spoons” will eventually disable its bodily and reproductive functions.
