# Harpy

5 HP, Armor 1, 12 STR, 12 DEX, 13 WIL, claws (d6+d6) or song (save)

- Hideous monstrosities with the body of a giant eagle and a humanoid head.
- Charming Song: Anyone who hears the song of a harpy must save WIL or be charmed, following the harpy and defending it from any threat. Killing the harpy breaks the charm.
