9 HP, 2 Armor, 13 STR, 12 WIL, bite (d6)

- Monstrous shape-shifters that take on the form of inanimate objects made of wood and stone. Found only underground.
- Remain motionless (generally in the form of chests or doors), attacking anything that touches it.
- Anything that touches the mimic is stuck in the glue that it exudes. Released only if the mimic is killed.
