# Tarrasque
18 HP, 3 Armor, 18 STR, 8 WIL, claws (d12+d12), Detachment 
-   Legendary, gargantuan (50’ long) reptilian monstrosities with plated skin, dreaded throughout all lands. Spend most of their time sleeping in their underground lairs. Emerge periodically and ravage vast swaths of land, consuming all plants and animals in the path. Possibly the most feared monster of all.
-   Regenerates 1 HP every turn. A Tarrasque always regenerates, even if its body is reduced to pieces. The way of permanently killing it is unknown.
-   Critical Damage: The razor-sharp claws sever a part of the victim's body.
