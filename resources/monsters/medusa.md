# Medusa

10 HP, 8 STR, 12 DEX, 16 WIL, snake bite (d8)

- Magical creatures that resemble humanoid women, but have snakes in place of hair. Proud and territorial. 
- **Gaze**: Those who look into the eyes of the Medusa are quickly turned to stone (its reflection is harmless). Attacks against it are almost normally _impaired_.
- If severed, a Medusa’s head maintains its powers for a full day.
