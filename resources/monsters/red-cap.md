6 HP, 6 STR, 12 DEX, 8 WIL, dual sickles (d6+d6)

- Born from blood left to rot in the land of Fairy. Their hats are a deep red from the blood they bathe in.
- Ignore those with little to live for, as there is no pleasure in their murder.
- **Critical Damage**: Target is eviscerated, the spray of their blood restoring STR loss suffered by the Red Cap.
