# Berserker

10 HP, 1 Armor, 14 STR, 13 DEX, 15 WIL, twin axes (d8+d8)

- Ruthless warriors that derive their power from the skins they wear: bears, wolves, boars, etc.
- Ignore the **Morale** rule and are never treated as part of a _detachment_.
- **Rage**: A Berserker's first attack has both the _enhanced_ and _blast_ qualities.
