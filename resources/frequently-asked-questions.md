## Introduction
Below are a few answers to some of the most commonly asked questions from folks new to Cairn.  
Please refer to the [SRD](/cairn-srd.html) while reading the following, particularly with regards to [**saves**](/cairn-srd.html#rules) and [combat](/cairn-srd.html#combat).

**Keep the following in mind when reading the example text!**  
- **Elin** is playing **Esme**, an ex-**Herbalist**.
- **Boris** plays a a **Hunter** called **Borrid**.
- The PCs are in search of a powerful [**Relic**](/cairn-srd.html#magic), rumored to have restorative powers.
- It is rumored to be located deep in the **Geunant Forest**, a wood known for having massive, ancient trees that allow little light through their humongous leaves.
- During character generation it was decided that the PCs were both previously employed by the same wealthy benefactor, who owned lands adjacent to their destination.
- Recently the party uncovered a hidden parchment that detailed the item's true location.

## How does a PC's knowledge and experience effect the game?
A character's relevant background, history, and experiences may provide a potential benefit (or disadvantage) to certain situations. Similarly, previous events in the game may influence the impact of their actions, including negating the need for a **save** in some circumstances!

 _**Esme** & **Borrid** have spent the better part of the day cutting their way through the **Geunant Forest**, chopping past hanging vines and waist-high brambles. **Borrid** stops every few minutes to survey their surroundings, relying on his background as a **Hunter** to ensure the party does not get lost._

 _Eventually, the party comes across an unusual flowering plant blocking their way. It sits in a solitary sunbeam, dripping a vile green ichor from open, violet pods. **Elin** asks the Warden if his PC knows the plant. The Warden says yes, **Esme** knows the plant, and that it probably is overgrown on account of the sunbeam drenching it in natural light._

 _**Boris** and **Elin** think on this, and then come up with a way to block the light coming from overhead. They carefully execute this plan (avoiding the thorns, of course) and the pods close up. They move on in safety._

 **How did the Warden decide what the PC should be allowed to know?**
 - First, they reasoned that **Esme's** background (**Herbalist**) would give her _some_ information about the plant (e.g. that it was poisonous, and how much the light would impact it).  
 - Then, they took into account the fact that this forest was known for rarely allowing light to penetrate the large leaves hanging overhead. **Esme** would definitely know this was a major factor.

 **What if none of the PCs had any relevant experience or expertise?**
 - Had there been no PC with the **Herbalist** background, the Warden would likely have declared the PCs ignorant of the plant's properties, and (hopefully) the players would try to learn more by asking questions and experimentation.
 - If a PC had a _tangential_ background (like the **Hunter**) the Warden could let the [Fates decide](/cairn-srd.html#die-of-fate) and roll 1d6. The higher the roll, the more likely the PC would know something relevant or useful.

## What determines whether combat should break out?
**Cairn** assumes that the characters live in a dangerous world where even the most minor interaction can become quite deadly. The players should therefore be encouraged to find non-violent ways to solve their problems. There are of course times where this is quite impossible, and it is up to the Warden to determine if a violent situation should be resolved through combat.

 _In the late afternoon the party makes a last push to break through the forest boundary. Spilling out of the treeline, they find themselves nearly stepping into a long ravine splitting the forest in two. Finally, they've arrived at the **God-Slip**, a seemingly endless ravine with no bridge crossing it. Judging by the sheer rock walls on either side, climbing down would be extremely dangerous. Unfortunately their quarry is most likely located just across, where the cliffs meet the edge of the world. They decide to make camp before moving out._

 _They set up camp with their backs to the ravine, judging it to be one fewer thing they'd have to worry about at night. Later that evening, the adventurers decide to take turns at keeping watch. **Esme** takes the first shift. Halfway through, she hears a snapping of twigs coming from just to the West of their camp, back towards the **Geunant Forest**. Slowly, she leans over towards **Borrid** and kicks him awake. Nodding her head towards the direction of the noise, she makes the symbol for be quiet. Her companion sits up, just as a pair of horrid red eyes become visible behind the underbrush._

 _The Warden then asks, "What do you do?" The players know that whatever creatures stalking the forest at night are very likely dangerous. They agree that direct combat is likely their best option, as the beasts of the night rarely have time to chat._

## How does the Warden decide turn order?
Some games rely on "Initiative" to determine who goes first when combat begins. In **Cairn**, the PCs must each make a **DEX save** in order to act before their opponents. After that round has been concluded, the two "sides" each take turns attacking, their individual members acting in whatever order they wish. In some cases a **DEX save** may _not_ be necessary, especially when the PC or NPC was on guard or ready for an attack.

 _The Warden decrees that **Esme** should not have to make a **DEX** save to go first, as she was at the ready when their opponent first appeared. **Boris** however must make a **DEX save** to see if his character is able to ready himself for combat in time. He rolls 1d20, and the result is a 17, a fail. The Warden decrees that **Esme** will go first, then their opponent, and finally **Borrid**._

 _A horse-like creature explodes from the darkness of the wood opposite the party's campsite, its red glowing eyes shrouded by a sea of mist. It runs directly at the still-prone **Borrid**. "A [**Nightmare**](/monsters/nightmare.html)!" screams **Esme**, before using her action to help drag her comrade out of the way. Barely missing its target, the **Nightmare** swings wildly around, stamping its feet in preparation for another charge._

## When Should a PC, NPC or monster **save**?
There are generally to two conditions that _must be met_ under which a PC, NPC or monster should **save**:
- The outcome of an action is uncertain
- Something is at risk (a life, a threatening danger, etc.).
- When making a critical damage save during [**combat**](/cairn-srd.html#combat)).

 _"There must be a [**Lich**](/monsters/lich.html) afoot," **Borrid** replies as he quickly gets to his feet. Both adventurers are now standing just to the East of their now-trampled campsite, close to a tree located only steps away from the cavernous **God-Slip**. It is now their turn to go, in any order they like, followed by the demon horse. **Borrid** has only his hip-knife for combat, as everything else is still at the camp._

 _**Boris** comes up with an idea: the creature previously charged at **Borrid**, so it seems reasonable that it would do so again. What if **Esme** tossed one end of her rope to **Borrid**, then quickly looped her rope to the nearby tree? Then if it comes close enough try and trample him again, **Borrid** could simply leap off the cliff, holding the rope for support and using **Esme's** body as a ballast.  **Elin** agrees to the plan._

 _**Esme** tosses one end of her rope to **Boroth**, then quickly wraps the rope around the nearby tree. At the same time, **Boroth** rushes towards the cliff-face, screaming at the creature to charge him. Both PCs are in position when the **Nightmare** makes another attempt at his life. He leaps off the cliff at the last second, holding onto the rope with all his might._

 **Why didn't Esme need to save in order to drag her friend away, or to wrap the rope around the tree?**  
 On a turn, a PC can attempt any action; a **save** is only required if the above two conditions are met. It seemed reasonable that **Esme** would be able to make a mad dash around the tree (which was only a few feet away) with **Borrid's** rope without much danger. Had she tried to run close to the **Nightmare** or done something equally uncertain or dangerous however she would have been required to **save**.

## In a contested action, who should **save**?
If two opponents are both attempting to overcome the other, whomever is most at risk should **save**. The Warden should make a _consistent_ ruling in this regard, and make sure it is explained clearly to the players before a risk is taken if possible.

 _The **Nightmare** attempts to halt its attack just as its target falls. The Warden makes a **DEX save** to see if it succeeds. He rolls a 20, and the creature goes tumbling off the cliff and into the vast dark below._

 **Why did the Nightmare have to make the save instead of Boroth?**  
 In this example, the **Nightmare** was far more at risk than its human opponent, because:   
 - As an enthralled beast, it was likely not capable of creative thinking or advanced problem solving.
 - One of its primary features is its relative bulk and speed, and it is likely that these properties would make a sudden stop quite difficult.
 - Accordingly, there were no situational or mechanical benefits that could provide any advantage to the **Nightmare** in this scenario.

 Conversely, **Boroth** was the least at risk of the two:
 - As a former hunter, he had already firmly established his ability to do things of this nature.
 - **Esme** had tied the rope around a tree, using herself as a ballast. This provided a situational advantage.

 If he had been injured or had less time to prepare, it would be conceivable to ask for a **STR save** to see if he could hold on to the rope, but only if there had been no opponent.

## How is damage awarded outside of combat?
Occasionally a dangerous action, trap, surprise attack, or cataclysmic event will cause grave injury (or even death). Typically the Warden declares the type of damage (e.g. **STR/DEX/WIL**) followed by the amount lost (either in terms of specific amounts, or a variable dice roll).
It can be difficult to determine exactly what kind of damage to dole out, and how much.

 _After their encounter with the **Nightmare**, **Borrid** and **Esme** return to camp and try to catch as much sleep as they can. By daybreak both are awake and ready to continue on their journey. The question is, how? The **God-Slip** appears equally insurmountable now, although the Warden points out that they can see a small shelf jutting out from inside the ravine just a few hundred meters South. It might require a little work to shimmy down, but it does look feasible._

 _After a half hour's walk along the broken, unforgiving mountainous crest they finally arrive at its edge,unable to go any further. Beneath them is an endless forest valley, blanketed in the early morning fog. _**Borrid** searches until he finds a large stone near the edge. He hammers one of his pitons into it then loops his rope through, creating a makeshift cable with which both adventures could lower themselves safely into the ravine and onto the shelf._

 _**Borrid** carefully lowers himself onto the shelf while **Esme** keeps an eye on the stone. Carefully planting his feet on the shelf, he tests the rope and calls up to his partner, who climbs down. After she arrives safely on the shelf, they sorrowfully leave the rope behind for the return journey. The shelf appears to zigzag down the inside of the ravine, nearly to the bottom. The sounds of rushing water below fills the ravine._

 _The party moves carefully down the shelf, digging their fingers into the cliff-face for safety. To ward off the growing shadows, **Esme** lights her torch. A half-hour into their descent they arrive at a small waterfall blocking their way forward. The water flows down the slippery rock surface and into a small basin below before tumbling into the dark abyss._

 _The Warden explains that the rock wall is slick with moss, and that they will likely slip if they try to step through. **Boris** argues that they should press on, despite the dangers. The Warden says that **Borrid** must make a **DEX save** to see if he can cross over the slick surface without slipping. **Boris** rolls a 14, a fail. He slips and tumbles down the waterfall into the water-filled basin below._

 _**Boris** groans and prepares for some bad news. The Warden declares that **Borrid** loses 1d4 STR damage, and that one item from his pack is also knocked loose. Rolling a Fate dice (with a lucky 5), the Warden says **Boris** can choose what his PC drops._

### Which **Ability** should non-combat damage impact?
- If the injury affects their physical strength or health, subtract from **STR**. _This does not trigger a **critical damage save**_. **STR** is a reflection of a PC's health, and should reflect that in subtle but interesting ways: perhaps requiring a **save** where none would have been necessary before.
- If the injury impacts their ability to move, react quickly, or their fine motor skills, subtract from **DEX**. This frequently is paired with an in-fiction impact as well; broken fingers would impact a PC's ability to pick locks, for example.
- If the spirit, willpower, or determination of a PC has been impacted, subtract from **WIL**. Especially helpful to consider during magical or superficial injuries. A PC whose soul was burnt by arcane energy may need to make a **WIL** save to read Spellbooks, for example.

A few considerations:
- An injury could take on multiple facets: [**Deprivation**](/cairn-srd.html#rules) may accompany STR loss from poison, for instance. Provide a potential solution to overcoming the illness. as well.
- Damage should happen as a consequence of failing a **save**. Do not make players **save** after-the-fact.
- Fictional injuries are just as powerful as direct mechanical damage. **DEX** loss will have an impact on a character's reflexes and speed, but a broken leg may prevent a character from being able to move at all!

## Can the fiction negate mechanics?

 _Clambering out of the basin, **Borrid** calls up to his comrade. "Well, that was a bad idea." **Esme** laughs, then asks, "How exactly are you going to get back up here without a rope?" **Boris** asks the Warden to tell him everything **Borrid** can see and hear from his new position. "There isn't much light here, but something glints in the darkness beneath you. If you had more light, you could perhaps make out what it is."_

 _**Elin** suggests that her character could toss **Borrid** her lamp, which is still dry. **Boris** agrees, and soon the party has a decent view of the chasm beneath them. The Warden describes a series of waterfalls, basins and protruding shelves going all the way down to a rushing river on the bottom. There is even a narrowing of the ravine itself just below them where they could conceivably leap over to the other side!_

## How do PCs advance without things like levels or XP?
In **Cairn**, character _growth_ is preferable over _advancement_. This means that although a PC _will_ change, they may not necessarily get _better_ with time. Growth occurs through both mechanical means (such as [**Scars**](/cairn-srd.html#scars)), as well as through events happening solely in the fiction.

The Warden should consider the following when awarding non-mechanical growth to PCs:
- Growth should be tied to a _specific_ experience occurring in the fiction.
- It is better for a PC to become more _interesting_ than more skilled or capable.
- PCs experience growth not necessarily because they've gotten more skill and experience, but because they are _changed_ in a significant way.
- There should be opportunities for growth & change everywhere, _especially_ when a PC puts themselves at risk.
- Growth occurs _while things are happening_, not after the PC has rested.
