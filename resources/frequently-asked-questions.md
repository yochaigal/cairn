## Introduction
Below are a few answers to some of the most commonly asked questions from folks new to Cairn.  
Please refer to the [SRD](/cairn-srd/) while reading the following, particularly with regards to [**saves**](/cairn-srd/#rules) and [combat](/cairn-srd/#combat).

**Keep the following in mind when reading the example text!**  
- **Esther** is playing an ex-**Herbalist**.
- **Barry** plays a former **Hunter**.
- The PCs are in search of a powerful [**Relic**](/cairn-srd/#magic), rumored to have restorative powers.
- It is rumored to be located on the far East side of the **Geunant Forest**, a wood known for having massive, ancient trees that allow little light through their humongous leaves.
- During character generation it was decided that the PCs were both previously employed by the same wealthy benefactor, who owned lands adjacent to their destination.
- Recently, the party uncovered a hidden parchment that detailed the item's true location.

## How does a PC's knowledge and experience effect the game?
A character's relevant background, history, and experiences may provide a potential benefit (or disadvantage) to certain situations. Similarly, previous events in the game may influence the impact of their actions, including negating the need for a **save** in some circumstances!

 **Warden**: _"You've spent the better part of the morning cutting your way through the **Geunant Forest**, chopping past hanging vines and waist-high brambles. It is very easy to get lost here among the surrounding underbrush. To make matters worse the Sun is completely obscured by the thick overhead branches."_

 **Barry**: _"Does my **Hunter** background help at all?"_

 **Warden:** _"Yes, though you have to stop every few minutes to survey your surroundings; progress is slow-going as a result. You continue heading East towards your destination."_

 **Warden:** _"After a few hours you exit into a small clearing in the wood, perfect for a short break. On the other end of the clearing is a small, visible path heading East. The entrance to the path is blocked by a large flowering plant, sitting a solitary sunbeam; it drips a green ichor from open, blue pods."_

 **Esther**: _"As a former **Herbalist**, do I recognize this plant?"_

 **Warden**: _"Yes. You also knows that it is probably overgrown on account of the sunbeam drenching it in natural light."_

**Esther**: _"What do the colors tell me about the plant? Is it poisonous? What about the green ichor?"_

**Warden**: _"You observe all these things, and reckon that yes it is very likely poisonous, as the petals closely resemble that of Wolfsbane."_

 **Barry**: _"Alright, here's the plan: I'll climb up one of these trees above the plant and drape my blanket over it, blocking the sunlight. Hopefully that'll make the pods close up!"_

 **What if none of the PCs had any relevant experience or expertise?**
 - Had there been no PC with the **Herbalist** background, the Warden would likely have declared the PCs ignorant of the plant's properties, and (hopefully) the players would try to learn more by asking questions and experimentation.
 - If a PC had a _tangential_ background (like the **Hunter**) the Warden could let the [Fates decide](/cairn-srd/#die-of-fate) and roll 1d6. The higher the roll, the more likely the PC would know something relevant or useful.

## When should combat break out?
**Cairn** assumes that the characters live in a dangerous world where even the most minor interaction can become quite deadly. The players should therefore be encouraged to find non-violent ways to solve their problems. There are of course times where this is quite impossible, and it is up to the Warden to determine if a violent situation should be resolved through combat.

 **Warden**: _"By late afternoon you finally break through the forest boundary. Spilling out of the treeline, you nearly step into a deep chasm splitting the forest in two. Finally, you have arrived at the **God-Slip**, a seemingly endless ravine with no bridge crossing it. Judging by the sheer rock walls on either side, climbing down would be extremely dangerous. Unfortunately, your quarry is likely located just across, where the cliffs meet the edge of the world. There is a small clearing nearby where you could set up camp, shrouded by a humongous Oak tree planted close to the chasm."_

 **Esther**: _"I think we should make camp before moving out. If we have to climb into or around this chasm, I'd rather have the light on our side!"_

 **Barry**: _"Definitely. I wonder what the safest way to do it would be? Backs against the ravine?"_

 **Warden**: _"Yes, unless of course something comes out of it!" Who's on first watch, by the way?"_

 **Esther**: _"I'll take first shift._"

  **Warden**: _"You make camp and eat one of your rations. Halfway through the first shift, you hear a snapping of twigs coming from just to the West of the campsite, back towards the **Geunant Forest**. What do you do?"_

  **Esther**: _"I'd like to kick my comrade awake so I'm not alone in this, quietly nodding my head towards the direction of the noise and making the symbol for silence."_

  **Warden**: _"You do that, and he sits up just as a pair of horrid red eyes become visible behind the underbrush._"

  **Barry**: _"What do we know about the creatures here?"_

  **Warden**: _"You know that whatever creatures may be stalking this forest at night are very likely dangerous. You will likely not have time to chat with whatever is about to come out of there."_

  **Esther**: _"I'm prepared to fight, then. I stand up and draw my sword, ready for whatever comes."_

## How does the Warden decide turn order?
Some games rely on "Initiative" to determine who goes first when combat begins. In **Cairn**, the PCs must each make a **DEX save** in order to act before their opponents. After that round has been concluded, the two "sides" each take turns attacking, their individual members acting in whatever order they wish. In some cases a **DEX save** may _not_ be necessary, especially when the PC or NPC was on guard or ready for an attack.

 **Warden**: _"A horse-like creature with glowing-red eyes explodes from the darkness of the wood opposite the party's campsite. A sea of mist flows off the creature's body as it runs directly at you, **Barry**. However seeing how **Esther** was at the ready, she gets to go first."_

 **Barry**: _"What about me?"_

 **Warden**: _"You'll need to make a **DEX save** to see if you are able to ready yourself in time to react before the creature."_

 **Barry**: _"I rolled 1d20, and the result is a 17. Ouch."_

 **Warden**: _"Yes, that's a fail alright. **Esther** will go first, then the creature, and finally **Barry**."_

 **Barry**: _"Do we know anything about this creature?"_

 **Warden**: _"Yes - it's a [**Nightmare**](/monsters/nightmare/), which is a fairly well-known thralls of Liches and the like. They are pretty powerful, from what you've heard."_

 **Esther**: _"Spooky! In that case, I want to use my action to help drag my comrade out of the way, maybe towards that Oak tree you mentioned earlier."_

 **Warden**: _"You do that. The **Nightmare** plows through the campsite, barely missing its target. It swings wildly around, nearly careening off the cliff-face in the process. It's eyes glow a hateful violet as it turns back towards you."_

## When Should a PC, NPC or monster **save**?
There are generally three scenarios under which a PC, NPC or monster should **save**:
- When the outcome of an action is uncertain.
- When something is at risk (a life, a threatening danger, etc.).
- When making a critical damage save during [**combat**](/cairn-srd/#combat)).

 **Warden**: _"**Esther**, you've managed to pull **Barry** just to the East of the now-trampled campsite, close to the Oak tree located just steps away from the **God-Slip**. **Barry**, you have only your hip-knife for combat, as everything else is still at the camp. It's your turn, by the way."_

 **Barry**: _"I step to my feet and declare,'There must be a [**Lich**](/monsters/lich/) afoot!' Screaming, I launch my dagger straight at the creature. I roll 1d6 and the result is a 1."_

 **Warden**: _"The knife flies expertly from your hand, slicing through the misty air just above the creature. It whinnies in anger, then crouches as it prepares to charge again. It's your side's turn now. Go in any order."_

 **Esther**: _"I have an idea: the creature previously charged at **Barry**, right? So it seems reasonable that it would do so again. What if I tossed one end of my rope to **Barry**, and then looped it to a nearby tree? Then if it comes close enough try and trample him again, he could just... leap off the cliff? Holding the rope for support, of course."_

 **Barry**: _"Uh... That sounds like a plan, I guess. Yes, let's do it!"_

 **Warden**: _"**Esther**, you toss one end of your rope to **Barry**, who quickly loops the rope around the Oak tree, then rushes towards the cliff-face on the other side, screaming at the creature to charge at him. **Esther** takes point as a sort of ballast in case he falls. **Barry**, as you are in position to react, I'm going to allow you a sort of out of combat reaction."_

 **Why didn't Barry need to save in order to drag her friend away, or to wrap the rope around the tree?**  
 On a turn, a PC can attempt any action; a **save** is only required if one of the two conditions listed above are met. It seemed reasonable that he would be able to make a mad dash around the tree (which was only a few feet away) with the rope without much danger. Had he tried to run close to the **Nightmare** or done something equally uncertain or dangerous, he would have been required to **save**.

## In a contested action, who should save?
 If two opponents are both attempting to overcome the other, whomever is most at risk should **save**. The Warden should make a _consistent_ ruling in this regard, and make sure it is explained clearly to the players before a risk is taken if possible.

  **Barry**: _"Alright, if it comes near me I'd like to stand near the cliff edge, ready to leap out of the way."_

  **Warden**: _"Understood. It is now the **Nightmare's** turn, and obviously it's still very angry at **Barry**. Raising its devilish hooves, the beast charges towards you. You leap off the cliff at the last second, holding onto the rope with all your might. The **Nightmare** attempts to halt its attack the moment it sees its target falling. It makes a **DEX save** to see if it can successfully stop itself. Ack, it rolled a 20, and the creature goes tumbling off the cliff and into the vast dark below."_

 **Why did the Nightmare have to make the save instead of Barry, who was also at risk?**  
 In this example, the **Nightmare** was far more at risk than its human opponent, because:   
 - As an enthralled beast, it was likely not capable of creative thinking or advanced problem solving.
 - One of its primary features is its relative bulk and speed, and it is likely that these properties would make a sudden stop quite difficult.
 - Accordingly, there were no situational or mechanical benefits that could provide any advantage to the **Nightmare** in this scenario.

 Conversely, **Barry** was the least at risk of the two:
 - As a former hunter, he had already firmly established his ability to do things of this nature.
 - **Esther** had tied the rope around a tree, using herself as a ballast. This provided a clear *situational* advantage.

 If **Barry** had been injured or had less time to prepare, it would be conceivable to ask for a **STR save** to see if he could hold on to the rope, but only if there had been no opponent.

## How is damage awarded outside of combat?
Occasionally a dangerous action, trap, surprise attack, or cataclysmic event will cause grave injury (or even death). Typically the Warden declares the type of damage (e.g. **STR/DEX/WIL**) followed by the amount lost (either in terms of specific amounts, or a variable dice roll).
It can be difficult to determine exactly what kind of damage to dole out, and how much.

 _After their encounter with the **Nightmare**, **Barry's PC** and **Esther's PC** return to camp and try to catch as much sleep as they can. By daybreak both are awake and ready to continue on their journey. The question is, how? The **God-Slip** appears equally insurmountable now, although the Warden points out that they can see a small shelf jutting out from inside the ravine just a few hundred meters South. It might require a little work to shimmy down, but it does look feasible._

 _After a half hour's walk along the broken, unforgiving mountainous crest they finally arrive at its edge,unable to go any further. Beneath them is an endless forest valley, blanketed in the early morning fog. **Barry's PC** searches until he finds a large stone near the edge. He hammers one of his pitons into it then loops his rope through, creating a makeshift cable with which both adventures could lower themselves safely into the ravine and onto the shelf._

 _**Barry's PC** carefully lowers himself onto the shelf while **Esther's PC** keeps an eye on the stone. Carefully planting his feet on the shelf, he tests the rope and calls up to his partner, who climbs down. After she arrives safely on the shelf, they sorrowfully leave the rope behind for the return journey. The shelf appears to zigzag down the inside of the ravine, nearly to the bottom. The sounds of rushing water below fills the ravine._

 _The party moves carefully down the shelf, digging their fingers into the cliff-face for safety. To ward off the growing shadows, **Esther's PC** lights her torch. A half-hour into their descent they arrive at a small waterfall blocking their way forward. The water flows down the slippery rock surface and into a small basin below before tumbling into the dark abyss._

 _The Warden explains that the rock wall is slick with moss, and that they will likely slip if they try to step through. **Barry** argues that they should press on, despite the dangers. The Warden says that **Barry's PC** must make a **DEX save** to see if he can cross over the slick surface without slipping. **Barry** rolls a 14, a fail. He slips and tumbles down the waterfall into the water-filled basin below._

 _**Barry** groans and prepares for some bad news. The Warden declares that **Barry's PC** loses 1d4 STR damage, and that one item from his pack is also knocked loose. Rolling a Fate dice (with a lucky 5), the Warden says **Barry** can choose what his PC drops._

### Which **Ability** should non-combat damage impact?
- If the injury affects their physical strength or health, subtract from **STR**. _This does not trigger a **critical damage save**_. **STR** is a reflection of a PC's health, and should reflect that in subtle but interesting ways: perhaps requiring a **save** where none would have been necessary before.
- If the injury impacts their ability to move, react quickly, or their fine motor skills, subtract from **DEX**. This frequently is paired with an in-fiction impact as well; broken fingers would impact a PC's ability to pick locks, for example.
- If the spirit, willpower, or determination of a PC has been impacted, subtract from **WIL**. Especially helpful to consider during magical or superficial injuries. A PC whose soul was burnt by arcane energy may need to make a **WIL** save to read Spellbooks, for example.

A few considerations:
- An injury could take on multiple facets: [**Deprivation**](/cairn-srd/#rules) may accompany STR loss from poison, for instance. Provide a potential solution to overcoming the illness. as well.
- Damage should happen as a consequence of failing a **save**. Do not make players **save** after-the-fact.
- Fictional injuries are just as powerful as direct mechanical damage. **DEX** loss will have an impact on a character's reflexes and speed, but a broken leg may prevent a character from being able to move at all!

## Can the fiction negate mechanics?

 _Clambering out of the basin, **Barry's PC** calls up to his comrade. "Well, that was a bad idea." **Esther's PC** laughs, then asks, "How exactly are you going to get back up here without a rope?" **Barry** asks the Warden to tell him everything **Barry's PC** can see and hear from his new position. "There isn't much light here, but something glints in the darkness beneath you. If you had more light, you could perhaps make out what it is."_

 _**Esther** suggests that her character could toss **Barry's PC** her lamp, which is still dry. **Barry** agrees, and soon the party has a decent view of the chasm beneath them. The Warden describes a series of waterfalls, basins and protruding shelves going all the way down to a rushing river on the bottom. There is even a narrowing of the ravine itself just below them where they could conceivably leap over to the other side!_

## How do PCs advance without things like levels or XP?
In **Cairn**, character _growth_ is preferable over _advancement_. This means that although a PC _will_ change, they may not necessarily get _better_ with time. Growth occurs through both mechanical means (such as [**Scars**](/cairn-srd/#scars)), as well as through events happening solely in the fiction.

The Warden should consider the following when awarding non-mechanical growth to PCs:
- Growth should be tied to a _specific_ experience occurring in the fiction.
- It is better for a PC to become more _interesting_ than more skilled or capable.
- PCs experience growth not necessarily because they've gotten more skill and experience, but because they are _changed_ in a significant way.
- There should be opportunities for growth & change everywhere, _especially_ when a PC puts themselves at risk.
- Growth occurs _while things are happening_, not after the PC has rested.
