# Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems. Here are some tips and guides that might help with the process.

### The Basics
Review the instructions in the [SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#creating-monsters). A couple of things to keep in mind:
- STR is both health and physical power. Sometimes HP/HD from other systems is better represented _here_.
- HP is _not_ health. It's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill.
- HD = HP is a good guide, assuming that HD = d6 (averaged) and the minimum is 4 HP (Cairn).
- Sometimes a direct stat to stat translation isn't an option. That's OK! There is a way.
- WIL is tricky. It's 10 if not noted otherwise; it rarely comes up but when it does, it's nice to have.
- Attacks are usually the easiest coming from B / X (you can usually copy them as-is). It can be tricky with non-weapons as well. Try looking at how much serious damage the creature can do! 

### Use The Fiction
Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

### An Example
Take for example this OSR creature:

####
**Foxwoman**
Can take the form of a fox, a woman, or a 7' tall fox-headed.  
HD d8 HP HDx4 Speed 120' Armor 14 Morale 11 Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_Using the example above, I can see that it:_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to metal weapons.
- Agile and lithe.
- Attacks with teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).

_Which tells me:_
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. She probably has higher than average Hit Protection (regular humans have 3 HP). **6 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. Normal human is 10 and she's bigger. **12 STR**
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**
- Foxes are usually pretty cunning, right? Probably forceful and proactive in a tough situation. **11 WIL**
- I'd go with bite (d6) for the teeth attack, and claws (d8+d8). the same as any two-handed weapon.

_In summary, that leaves us with the following opening statblock:_  
6 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)

_For her abilities:_  
These are easy. Just copy the fictional stat block created earlier!
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Can transform into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on.
