## Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.
PCs roll a *d20* for an appropriate ability score.
If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass.
Otherwise, they fail.
In a contest, the highest successful roll wins.

 _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a *d20*, and resulting in a 10 – a success!_

## Combat

### Attacking

The attacker rolls their weapon die, equal to or under an **Ability**.
When successful, subtract the roll from the target's **Armour**, then deal the remaining total as Harm.

### Multiple Attacks

If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all attack dice and keep the single highest result.
If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both dice dice and keep the highest.

### Blast

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character.
Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite.
If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

### Initiative & Retreat

Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make an **Insight** save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful **Insight** save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## Roll Modifiers

In some circumstances your roll is **Impaired** or **Enhanced**.
When **Impaired** you roll your dice twice, and take the worst result.
When **Enhanced** you roll your dice twice and take the best result.

## Effort

You can chose to make an effort and, before any roll, take *1d6* [Harm](/system/rules/#harm).
You now roll [Enhanced](/system/rules/#roll-modifiers).

## Harm

Harm is taken from Grit.
Harm that reduces a target's Grit **below** 0 decreases the remainder from

- **Prowess**, if it is physical harm.
- **Insight**, if it is a stress harm.
- **Resolve**, if it is an effort harm.

They must then make an [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) Save to avoid **critical harm**.
Some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a **critical harm** save.

### Critical harm

When **critically harmed**, the PC is taken out of combat and have their affected [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) reduced in *1* **permanently**.
The PC will die instantly if harmed further, and cannot do anything until stabilised.
If left to their own devices they die within the hour.

If a PC's **Ability** is reduced to 0 they:

- **die**, if it is **Prowess**.
- gain a **condition**, if it is **Insight**.
- **panic**, if it is **Resolve**.

When they are stable, if their new permanent [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) is equal or higher than their number of [Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements), they can choose an additional [Advancement](/system/characters/#advancements).

### Healing

Resting for a few hours and having a meal allow you to re-roll your **Grit**.
Ability loss (see **Critical Harm**) can usually be restored at a rate of one per day, if facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
**Deprived** PCs roll *-1d6* **Grit** when resting.

## Panic


| $d6$  | Panic Event Outcome                                                                                                               |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1:3$ | You **Flight**. Lose $1d6$ **Resolve**, and you are compelled to leave the scene.                                                 |
| $4:5$ | You **Freeze**. Lose $1d6$ **Prowess**, and you cannot move, silently or otherwise.                                               |
|  $6$  | You **Fight**. Lose $1d6$ **Insight**, and you become obsessed with being successful during the scene. You gain an *Advancement*. |

Describe the outcome narratively.
In any case, after the scene ends, you gain a *Condition*.
With the GM, determine the mechanical effects and how to introduce your *Condition* into the narrative.
## Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**.
When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

## Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

## Morale

Enemies must pass a **Resolve** save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
Some groups may use their leader's **Resolve** in place of their own.
Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 **Grit**.
Morale does not affect PCs.

## Fortune die

When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll *1d6*.

## Sayonara

If you are not Critically Harmed, you can decide it is your last scene.
When you do that, choose a song and then re-roll your *Grit*.
For this scene all your rolls are *Enhanced*.
By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, Etc.).
You can create a new character with half (rounded down) the number of *Advancements* the previous character had.
