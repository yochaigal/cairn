# Introduction to Cairn Barebones Edition

Cairn Barebones Edition is an adventure game about traversing underground tunnels, decrepit castles, dark forests, and other dreadful places. Character creation is entirely random and fast, exploration is tense and rewarding, and combat is chaotic and lethal. The rules and procedures match those in the _Cairn Second Edition Player’s Guide_, but this version removes the implied setting and structured creation process. It assumes a generic fantasy world, embracing full randomness, much like the original _Cairn_. It retains full compatibility with _Cairn Second Edition_ adventures but offers an even more minimal, flexible framework for old-school play.
