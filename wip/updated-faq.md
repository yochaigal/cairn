## Updated FAQ

### How do detachments work?

### How do you increase or decrease the difficulty and outcome of a save without advantage or disadvantage?

### How does autohit work?

### Do monsters use the same combat rules as PCs (e.g. critical save)?
- Yes, monsters use the exact same combat rules as PCs, with the exception of rolling on the [Scars Table](/cairn-srd#scars-1) at 0 HP.

### How does having 10 inventory slots actually work?

### What are examples of deprived conditions?

### How does the Armor cap work? What's the difference between Armor of equal values?

### How does initiative in combat work?
A standard combat scenario would work like this:

#### Round 1
- PCs make a DEX save. Those who successfully pass go before the enemies (collectively one "side"). They go in whatever order they wish; the results however are simultaneous.
- All enemies go, in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.

#### Round 2
- _All_ PCs (including those that failed the original DEX save) get to go in whatever order they wish. The results however are simultaneous.
- _All_ enemies get to go in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results however are simultaneous.

#### Round 3
- All PCs get to go, as per round 2.
- All enemies get to go, as per round 2.

And so on.
