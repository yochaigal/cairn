### Summary

About this region: it is covered in forest, and a river runs North to South. At one point (near Reprieve) the river becomes an enormous waterfall, and travelers must disembark at **Reprieve** and hike down to the base. 

**Waterfall City** is a bustling new frontier city, and only a small portion of roads and trails connect it to points 1-9. Points 10-17 are all unexplored and happen to the South. 

These lands were once ruled by a long-dead civilization, which has left behind some pretty powerful "magical items" (called Relics). There is now a Relic goldrush of sorts, where large amounts of gold are paid for the recovery of Relics from the ruins.
