# The Fallen Kingdom

## Basics

### Geographic themes
- Forest on all sides, 1-9
- Southern-flowing river, spilling into a waterfall (Heart)
- Heart is only traversable by stopping at encampment North, then trekking down. Cloud forest?
- River continues as land opens to non-forest, mostly plains, plateaus, grasslands etc but mountain range on the west side
- Current weather: Drizzly
- River: The Scar
- Forest? The Watersilk Weald?
- Language family

### Summary

A valley, discovered only decades earlier. Covered by thick forest and jungles, divided by a powerful river (The Scar). Ruins of an advanced civilization dot the forested landscape, but no evidence of their demise has been discovered.

A large waterfall (God's Spill) marks a central feature of the Upper Valley. The region's pseudo-capital (Waterfall City) draws from the fall's power to create mechanical marvels (lamps, machines), bringing the city great fame. Made possible only through the discovery of a relic called The Wheel, the city's majesty has spurred a Relic "gold rush", attracting prospectors and colonists the world over.   

The Fallen Kingdom's Southern Valley (beyond Dunny Town) is largely unexplored. Colonists and explorers have traveled South along the river, but few have returned. Those that did tell only inconsistent, wild and impossible tales.
