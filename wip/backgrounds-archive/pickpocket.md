# How were you caught?

|      |                     |                                                              |

| 1    | **Lack of Finesse** | Turns out walking right up to someone, holding direct eye contact, and shoving your hands straight into their pockets and purses is a great way to be immediately arrested. |
| 2    | **Mini Man Alarm**  | Bit by a pocket homunculus, your yelps gave you away.        |
| 3    | **Outplayed**       | Your last mark was a master counter-thief, every pence you thought you took from them somehow ended with every last thing you owned being transferred to them. |
| 4    | **Betrayed**        | One of your companions pointed you out to the sheriff, who used your capture as a feather in their cap. |
| 5    | **Loud Mouthed**    | After buying several rounds of ales, a stranger asked you how you came upon such good fortunes. You quickly learned that honesty is not always the best policy. |
| 6    | **Divination**      | After retiring from a career of adventuring, the local hedge mage decided to become a village detective. |

# What was the oddest thing you lifted?

|      |                              |                                                              |

| 1    | **Tiny Totem of Confidence** | A figure of a local deity carved from smooth stone, when it belly is rubbed you can hear affirmations in your head. |
| 2    | **Digestible Treasure**      | One purse full of imitation coins, the gold nothing but foil. The chocolate internals at least is a rare treat. |
| 3    | **Psychedelic Mold**         | The leather purse your stole from a visiting druid contained only patches of moist growth inside. Ingesting this made you acutely aware of the secret lives of colors and the varies polyhedral shapes living in-between wood grains. |
| 4    | **Pouch of Devouring**       | Fanged on the inside, this bag whines if not provided with a weekly meal. Seemingly able to digest all sorts of organic and inorganic material you can it into it without producing waste. Or at least, without producing waste _as of yet_. |
| 5    | **Monster Teeth**            | Unsettlingly, the local miller had a purse practically bursting with a variety of fangs, teeth, and claws. You are unsure if you should report them to someone, or if you can use these in some kind of ritual. |
| 6    | **Lovely Lich's Locket**     | Unsure who it belonged to, but someone in your village kept a heart-shaped locket with a rendition of the Dread Lich Pestulentia. Can you use this to your advantage? |
