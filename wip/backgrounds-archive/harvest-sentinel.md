|      |                                                              |

| 1    | You were once the victim of a terrible famine, and you vowed to do everything in your power to ensure no one else would have to experience that suffering. Take a farming almanac, a waterskin, and a symbol of your commitment to your cause (pendant or tattoo). |
| 2    | You discovered that your family was part of a long line of Harvest Sentinels, responsible for safeguarding the crops from both mundane and supernatural threats. You've inherited their legacy, along with a family heirloom, an enchanted scarecrow that can be controlled by a small whistle. Take the whistle and a straw hat. |
| 3    | A skilled druid took you under their wing, teaching you the importance of nature's balance and how to use your abilities to protect the harvest. They left you with a wooden staff that can grow small plants when pressed into the ground. Take the staff, a set of herbalism tools, and a pouch of seeds. |
| 4    | You once witnessed a celestial event that seemed to bless the land, resulting in a bountiful harvest. Ever since then, you've dedicated yourself to finding the secret of the celestial blessing, hoping to replicate it. Take a spyglass, a notebook to record your findings, and a quill and ink. |
| 5    | You discovered an ancient temple devoted to a forgotten harvest god, and you've taken up the mantle of their servant. You've learned rituals to protect the crops and ensure a good harvest. Take a set of ceremonial robes, a tome of rituals, and a censer with incense. |
| 6    | A powerful beast once terrorized your village, devouring the harvest and leaving the people hungry. You managed to drive the creature away, earning the title of Harvest Sentinel. Take a trophy from the beast (claw, tooth, or hide), a small hunting trap, and a net. |

## What do you carry that might identify you as a Harvest Sentinel?

| 1    | **Sickle Pendant**     | A small pendant in the shape of a sickle, a symbol of your devotion to protecting the harvest. It has a hidden compartment that contains a pinch of fertile soil from your homeland. |
| 2    | **Preserved Leaf**     | A leaf from a rare tree that grows only in the most fertile lands. It has been magically preserved and serves as a reminder of your duty. |
| 3    | **Fertility Amulet**   | An amulet adorned with symbols of fertility and growth. When worn during planting season, it is said to bring good fortune and a bountiful harvest. |
| 4    | **Bag of Seeds**       | A small, embroidered bag containing seeds from a variety of plants. As a Harvest Sentinel, you plant these seeds wherever you go, spreading new life and growth. |
| 5    | **Ceremonial Dagger**  | A dagger used in rituals to bless the land and ensure a good harvest. The blade is etched with intricate patterns and symbols of protection. |
| 6    | **Bracelet of Grains** | A bracelet made from woven stalks of various grains, symbolizing the unity of the harvest and the people who depend on it. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to...

The **Order of the Bountiful Harvest**. They trained you in the ways of the Harvest Sentinel and provided valuable resources and support during your early days. They now request that you and your party assist them in a delicate mission: to recover a stolen relic that ensures the fertility of the lands they protect. Failure to comply could result in the loss of their favor and potential complications with other like-minded groups.
