### 5e Notes
First choose the attributes you're converting. 
- For **STR**, choose the highest between STR or CON. 
- Convert **DEX** directly. 
- For **WIL** choose the highest between WIS or CHA.

Now to get the value, add 10 to the equivalent 5e **modifier**. So, a monster that has 19(+4) STR on 5e, will have 14 STR on Cairn. One that has 6(-2) Wisdom in 5e will have 8 WIL on Cairn.
 

#### AC to Armor
- 12 AC or less = no armor
- 13+ AC = 1 Armor
- 16+ AC = 2 Armor
- 20+ AC = 3 Armor

- For HP you can use **CR** as a starting point; but consider the "levels of threat".
- 1-6 HP are most humans, small animals and creatures of similar power.
- 7-12 HP are serious foes, people that are exceptionally trained or creatures of uncommon power. Large and ferocious animals, most monstrosities and extraplanar creatures fall here.
- 13-18 HP are large threats. Dragons, Giants, that sort of enemy that can cause massive destruction.

Attacks/damage are mostly as is, in the case of weapons, use the damage the weapon deals in Cairn rules. If a attack has a lot of damage dice, give it advantage (e.g. d8+d8) in Cairn. Use damage advantage in place of multiattacks too.
