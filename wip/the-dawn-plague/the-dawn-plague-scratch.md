# The Dawn Plague Scratch

[Sefer Hasidim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Hasidim)

[What are the Sefirot](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/sefirot/)

Opening text:

עשר ספירות בלי מה נעוץ סופן בתחלתן  
ותחלתן בסופן כשלהבת קשורה בגחלת  
שאדון יחיד ואין לו שני ולפני אחד מה אתה סופר  

עשר ספירות בלימה בלום פיך מלדבר  
ולבך מלהרהר ואם רץ לבך שוב למקום  
שלכך נאמר והחיות רצוא ושוב  
ועל דבר זה נכרת ברית  

## Details
### First of Espar
- Espar is the name of a month; a celebratory time as it marks the end of Summer
  and the beginning of the Fall harvest (the best of the year).
- A child born on this day or close to it is considered a sign of good things to
  come.
- Locals remember their ancestors, and what they had to do to survive on the
  Coast.
- They eat dried unsweetened cake to remember their ancestor’s paltry options
  for food.
- Consider renaming the month.

## Encounters
### The Cottage
- A short, squat cottage nestled among the trees. A small path leads directly to
  it.
- It appears before those that carry a great desire within them.
- It may be treasure, the way home, to see a friend one last time, etc.
- Within is a furnished living room, a kitchen, and a bedroom.
- Paintings line the wall. They show images of family & friends.
- The cottage can freely change its internal appearance to any form it desires.
- Spending more than a few minutes in the cottage will trigger the cottage’s
  spell.
- Thinking about a desire causes that object to magically appear.
- The objects feel real but are in fact illusions.
- Victims cannot leave the cottage in any normal way.
- Breaking the windows, floor or walls and “leaving” only leads back into the
  cottage.
- Objects summoned too quickly will begin to flicker or act unstable.
- There is a set limit of objects that the cottage can “summon”; a party of 3 or
  more PCs should be able to overwhelm it by desiring a dozen or so objects
  each.
