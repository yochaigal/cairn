# The Dawn Plague Scratch

[Sefer Hasidim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Hasidim)

[What are the Sefirot](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/sefirot/)

## Details
### First of Espar
- Espar is the name of a month; a celebratory time as it marks the end of Summer
  and the beginning of the Fall harvest (the best of the year).
- A child born on this day or close to it is considered a sign of good things to
  come.
- Locals remember their ancestors, and what they had to do to survive on the
  Coast.
- They eat dried unsweetened cake to remember their ancestor’s paltry options
  for food.

## Encounters
### The Cottage
- A short, squat cottage nestled among the trees. A small path leads directly to
  it.
- It appears before those that carry a great desire within them.
- It may be treasure, the way home, to see a friend one last time, etc.
- Within is a furnished living room, a kitchen, and a bedroom.
- Paintings line the wall. They show images of family & friends.
- The cottage can freely change its internal appearance to any form it desires.
- Spending more than a few minutes in the cottage will trigger the cottage’s
  spell.
- Thinking about a desire causes that object to magically appear.
- The objects feel real but are in fact illusions.
- Victims cannot leave the cottage in any normal way.
- Breaking the windows, floor or walls and “leaving” only leads back into the
  cottage.
- Objects summoned too quickly will begin to flicker or act unstable.
- There is a set limit of objects that the cottage can “summon”; a party of 3 or
  more PCs should be able to overwhelm it by desiring a dozen or so objects
  each.
