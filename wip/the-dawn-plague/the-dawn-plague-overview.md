# The Dawn Plague Overview

## Summary
- See the overland [map](/wip/the-dawn-plague/maps/the-dawn-plague-map.jpg).
- **Motal** is a small village seated between a thick forest and a restless sea.
- Devastated by something called "The Dawn Plague" decades before, the town has never fully recovered.
- The villagers keep to the old ways, carefully following ritual burial rites.  
- An outside lumber company has planted its stake in the local forest, and pays the town handsomely.
- Workers and their families have arrived, bringing with them their religion and customs.
- “Strange sightings” have raised tensions between the villagers and the new families.
- **Rab Schlomo** and his congregation have resorted to an ancient practice meant to protect the town from both outsiders and potential threats. Their efforts may have summoned a far worse threat to the town, with dire consequences.

## The Dawn Plague
- Thirty-three years ago, a hunting party from **Motal** found themselves lost in the **Blue Forest**, eventually taking their rest in a place haunted by bodiless Dybbuks. By morning, all were possessed.
- The newly-bodied Dybbuks then found their way to the village of **Motal**, retreating back to the forest after wreaking havoc on the frightened populace.
- The locals were ill-equipped to handle the situation. A small group of all able-bodied adults attempted to stop the Dybbuks on their own turf. All but one (**Zina**, a seamstress) did not return.
- **Zina** survived by climbing up a tree and observing the Dybbuks for a full night, never sleeping. She observed that the Dybbuks could only possess a body while the spirit slept, and that by morning they would have full control. She also saw that they _hated_ fire. She let one of the children know what she'd learned, then fled.
- The remaining residents (mostly children and the elderly **Rab**) were able to frighten their possessed former neighbors, parents and children with torches and flaming brands, forcing them into a nearby quarry. They then set it ablaze, killing the bodies but freeing the spirits. This place is now referred to as **Orphan’s Mound**.
- Today the locals still stand vigilant for a full night after any burial, to ensure that none are possessed by a Dybbuk. They endlessly repeat the phrase, “A candle for one is a candle for a hundred.” In general, the survivors became strict adherents of their ancestor's religious practices.
- The true details of what happened in **Motal** was kept secret, most outsiders believing them an unfortunate victims of a plague. The original **Rab** died a few years after the events of the **Dawn Plague**, but made great efforts to forestall anything ever harming the town again. Eventually, **Rab Schlomo** came and made his home among them, intending to understand and protect his newfound neighbors.
- **Zina** was never seen again, though she lives on as an **Estrie**, surviving from offerings left to her by the villagers.

## Hooks
- PCs are hired by a wealthy outsider, sent to quiet the unrest.
- The PCs stumble upon the town in their travels, just as workers and villagers are coming to blows. A local clergy or city official may ask for their assistance as outsiders.
- Rumors of abandoned treasure buried beneath a large burial mound not far from town.

### Evidence of Dybbuks
- Disturbed graves; mutilated animals. The sound of rocks moving in the forest.
- A gangly figure dressed in ragged clothing, seen only from afar.
- Last seen at the small abandoned cemetery North of town. Reports are unreliable.

### Last Culling
- A holiday marking the end of Fall as well as the final harvest.
- Locals remember those they'd lost during the **Dawn Plague**, and what they had to do to survive afterward.
- They eat dried unsweetened cake and attend services at the **Schul**.

- Can leap into the living to wreak havoc among the living. Grows more powerful the longer it maintains a bodily presence.
- Critical damage: target is immobilized and unconscious. If the body is not healed via a ritual prayer, the victim becomes a host for the Dybbuk.

### Root Witch
8 HP, 9 STR, 16 DEX, 14 WIL, tuber-fingers (d6)
- Excellent tunneler that hides underground near water. Wiggles tiny fronds into the air as lures.

- Critical damage: target is pulled underground, where they soon suffocate.

### Shtekn Folk
4 HP, 1 Armor, 11 STR, 8 DEX, 14 WIL, knotted fists (d8+d8)

### Zina (an Estrie)
10 HP, 11 STR, 15 DEX, 14 WIL, draining hair (1d8)
- Appears as a woman with long dark hair that extends all the way to her feet. Can transform into an owl at night.
- Drinking blood gives her power, but she can also obtain sustenance from eating bread and salt if taken from one she has wronged.
- Binding their hair prevents any transformation. Can be killed, but her head must be buried and the mouth stuffed with dirt.  
- Critical damage: target falls unconscious for 1d4 days.

### Shabriri, the Dazzler

- A hulking 9’ tall statue made of clay, mud, and prayer.
- Mindlessly follows whatever commands given by its master, even after their death.
- Immune to mundane blades and missile weapons. Damage from fire is _enhanced_.
- If destroyed, the Golem eventually reforms and carries out its previous orders.
- Uttering the inverse of the spell that created it reduces the Golem to mud.

## 1. First Light
- The oldest established homestead. Home to an elderly sisters who lost family to the **Dawn Plague**
- They trade mostly in candles. Some have magical or warding properties.
- A **Dybbuk** haunts the farm, but will not touch the sisters. They are its former children.

## 2. Shorehead Ruins
- A large, mostly worn-away temple that predates the arrival of the **Motal** colonists.
- Some theorize they represent ancient sea-faring peoples from across the **Silver Sea**.

## 3. The Tentyard
- Three structures lined in rows along the beach. They look like the ribs of a massive sea creature.
- A tarp is draped across one of the ribs. In the shade below, **Aroys-Geben** makes his home.
- He lives off fish and whatever trade he can find. He is also a spy for both the **Meyster** and **Gehilts**.

## 4. Motal
- A dozen rustic-looking wooden buildings form a perfect square in the center.
- A massive old-growth forest dominates the lands to the East, split by a small mountain.
- On the North side dozens of farms spill out along a long, dusty road. The road bends Northwest.

### Optional Hook
- When the PCs arrive, a group of 10 locals (identifiable by their drab clothing) are about to come to blows with 5 obviously foreign lumber workers.

### Meyster's Office
- A box-like wooden building that was clearly renovated quite recently. Carefully studying the facade reveals it was formerly a butcher's shop.
- **Meyster Zeydne** often naps here at lunch; otherwise the place is usually empty.
- The room is bare save for a small desk and comfortable chair. The desk is shut with a simple lock.
- Within is an unsigned document detailing an agreement that would hand over management of the village to the **Gehilts Lumber Company**. The signer would receive 20% of future lumber profits.
- The symbol of protection (an eye) is emblazoned on the surface of the drawer, beneath the paperwork.

### The Schul
- The oldest building in town, standing in stark contrast to the newer construction.
- The ground before the doorway is sprinkled with white flour. If a demon crosses the threshold, its footsteps appear as if a chicken made them.
- The temple within is musty and in dire need of repair. Dual rows of broken wooded seats line a cracked central causeway, which ends at a small stone platform taking up much of the opposite half.
- In the Southwest corner is an attached study where **Rab Shlomo** studies as well as sleeps.
- A mechanism in the study controls the stone platform, causing it to recede into the wall. A staircase leads down into **The Tomb**.

## 5. Orphan's Mound
- A mass-burial site for those that died of the **Dawn Plague**.
- Tended by the **Gravedigger**, **Motal’s** dead are brought here and burned.
- There is a **Root Witch** here, drawn by earth-tremblings from the Rab's research.
- **Gravedigger’s Hovel**: a paltry shack just next to the mound. **Kivyer** lives there.

## 6. The Blue Forest
- A thick, moss-covered forest of spruce, fir and maple trees. The forest is quite cold.
- At night, faint blue lights guide travelers deep into the woods, where they quickly become lost.
- The lights are in fact will o’ wisps that live in the moss, and feed off anything, including flesh.
- The bodies of frozen travelers from decades before still litter the forest, their belongings preserved in moss and frost.

## 7. Froyim’s Home
- **Froyim Greydinger** makes his home here. He is a well-respected merchant in these parts.
- Behind the unusually  modern cottage  is a small garden. A large tree sits in the Northwest corner.
- The **Dybbuk’s** first victim, as he travels frequently between his home and the coast.
- Upon arrival, the PCs will find the door smashed open and blood splattered everywhere.
- **Froyim’s** body is in the back garden, torn to shreds. If not burnt, it will rise as a **Dybbuk** at dawn.
- Hiding within the tree's mossy bark is a **Shtekn Folk** spy, which will try to run away (towards **Blue Forest**).

## 8. The Tomb
