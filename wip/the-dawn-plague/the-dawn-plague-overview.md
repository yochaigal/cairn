# The Dawn Plague Overview

## Summary
- See the overland [map](/wip/the-dawn-plague/maps/the-dawn-plague-map.jpg).
- **Drei Beymer** is a small village seated between a thick forest and a restless sea.
- Devastated by something called "The Dawn Plague" decades before, the town has never fully recovered.
- The villagers keep to the old ways, carefully following ritual burial rites.  
- An outside lumber company has planted its stake in the local forest, and pays the town handsomely.
- Workers and their families have arrived, bringing with them their religion and customs.
- “Strange sightings” have raised tensions between the villagers and the new families.
- **Rav Leib** and his congregation have resorted to an ancient practice meant to protect the town from both outsiders and potential threats. Their efforts may have summoned a far worse threat to the town, with dire consequences.

## The Dawn Plague
- Thirty-three years ago, a hunting party from **Drei Beymer** found themselves lost in the **Blue Forest**, eventually taking their rest in a place haunted by bodiless Dybbuks. By morning, all were possessed.
- The newly-bodied Dybbuks then found their way to the village of **Drei Beymer**, retreating back to the forest after wreaking havoc on the frightened populace.
- The locals were ill-equipped to handle the situation. A small group of all able-bodied adults attempted to stop the Dybbuks on their own turf. None returned
- An **Estrie** (see **Zina** below) nesting nearby observed the Dybbuks from on high, seeing that they could only possess a body while the spirit slept. She also saw that their _hated_ fire. She let one of the children know what she'd learned, then moved her nest to the **Blue Forest**. She feels great guilt for not helping the townsfolk further.
- The remaining residents (mostly children and the elderly) were able to chase their possessed  neighbors & parents with torches and flaming brands, forcing them into a nearby barn. They then set it ablaze, killing the bodies but freeing the spirits trapped within. This place is now referred to as **Orphan’s Mound**.
- Today the locals still stand vigilant for a full night after any burial, to ensure that none are possessed by a Dybbuk. They endlessly repeat the phrase, “A candle for one is a candle for a hundred.”
- An oath of secrecy was soon invoked, whereby a lie would be told from that day forward: a disease killed the older citizens of **Drei Beymer**. Breaking this taboo would result in expulsion from the community. One of the children grew up to become **Rav Leib**, and made great efforts to forestall such a harm happening ever again.

## Hooks
- PCs are hired by a wealthy outsider, sent to quiet the unrest.
- The PCs stumble upon the town in their travels, just as workers and villagers are coming to blows. A local clergy or city official may ask for their assistance as outsiders.
- Rumors of abandoned treasure buried beneath a large burial mound not far from town.

### Evidence of Dybbuks
- Disturbed graves; mutilated animals. The sound of rocks moving in the forest.
- A gangly figure dressed in ragged clothing, seen only from afar.
- Last seen at the small abandoned cemetery North of town. Reports are unreliable.

### Day of Remembrance
- A holiday marking the end of the final harvest. Locals remember those they'd lost during the **Dawn Plague**, and what they had to do to survive in the years after.
- In the week leading up to the event, a large display is built of two trees with interlocking limbs. As the sun rises, it is burned the villagers, who stand and watch in utter silence.
- Services at the Shul begin immediately afterwards, and then a large and joyous feast is enjoyed by all. There is much drinking.

## Places

### Landmarks
- A massive old-growth forest dominates the lands to the East, split by a small mountain.
- A few scattered homes litter the landscape, but there is only one "real" town: **Drei Beymer**.
- On the North side dozens of farms spill out along a long, dusty road that bends Northwest.

### 1. First Light
- The oldest established homestead. Home to two elderly women who both lost their families to the **Dawn Plague**.
- They trade mostly in candles. Some have magical or warding properties.
- A bodiless **Dybbuk** haunts the farm, but will not touch the residents, and feels protective of them after so many years.

### 2. Shorehead Ruins
- A large, mostly worn-away temple that predates the arrival of the **Drei Beymer** colonists.
- Some theorize they represent ancient sea-faring peoples from across the **Silver Sea**.

### 3. The Tentyard
- Three structures lined in rows along the beach. They look like the ribs of a massive sea creature.
- A tarp is draped across one of the ribs. In the shade below, **Aroys-Geben** makes his home.
- He lives off fish and whatever trade he can find. He is also a spy for both the **Meyster** and **Gehilts Company**.

### 4. Drei Beymer
- A small village with no more than two dozen rustic buildings. A handful of more modern looking wooden buildings form a perfect square in the center of the town, surrounding a large, ugly temple.
- The town derives its name from the **Shul**, which was originally built by "three trees" sources from the **Blue Forest**.

#### Optional Hook
When the PCs arrive, a group of 10 locals (identifiable by their darker clothing) are about to come to blows with 5 obviously foreign lumber workers.

#### Meyster's Office
- A box-like wooden building that was clearly renovated quite recently. Carefully studying the facade reveals it was formerly a butcher's shop.
- **Meyster Zeydne** often naps here at lunch; otherwise the place is usually empty.
- The room is bare save for a small desk and comfortable chair. The desk is shut with a simple lock.
- Within is an unsigned document detailing an agreement that would hand over management of the village to the **Gehilts Company**. The signer would receive 20% of future lumber profits.
- The symbol of protection (an eye) is emblazoned on the surface of the drawer, beneath the paperwork.

#### The Schul of Drei Beymer
- The oldest building in town, standing in stark contrast to the newer construction. Above the entry are three hares chasing each other, creating an [optical illusion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Paderborner_Dom_Dreihasenfenster.jpg/1024px-Paderborner_Dom_Dreihasenfenster.jpg) where "Three hares share three ears, yet each has only two."
- The ground before the doorway is sprinkled with white flour. If a demon crosses the threshold, its footsteps appear as if a chicken made them.
- The temple within is musty and in dire need of repair. Dual rows of broken wooded seats line a cracked central causeway, which ends at a small stone platform taking up much of the opposite half.
- In the Southwest corner is an attached study where **Rav Lieb** studies and sleeps. A small trapdoor (hidden by a trick carpet) leads down and into a small tunnel connecting the study to the kitchen in the **Giving Hospital**.
- A mechanism in the study controls the stone platform, causing it to recede into the wall. A staircase leads down into **The Sefirot**.

#### Giving Hospital
- A former makeshift hospital of sorts. There are only two rooms.
- The treatment room has ancient bandages rusted medical tools. Large bags are piled in the corner, filled with dirt.
- The kitchen appears unused; there is no food within. Beneath a small square of carpet is a trapdoor that connects to the **study** in the **Shul**.

#### Ritual Baths
- ???

#### Butcher Shop
- Schochet

### 5. Orphan's Mound
- A mass-burial site for those that died of the **Dawn Plague**.
- Tended by the **Kivyer**, the dead of **Drei Beymer** are brought here to be buried in the small cemetery nearby.
- A paltry shack sits astride the mound. **Kivyer** often works from here. Within is a small furnace and bookshelf with prayer books.
- There is a **Root Witch** here, drawn by the earth-tremblings from the **Rav Lieb's** efforts. She can be negotiated with to dig a tunnel to the **Sefirot** (into the water vein).   

### 6. The Blue Forest
- A thick, moss-covered forest of spruce, fir and maple trees. The forest is quite cold.
- At night, faint blue lights guide travelers deep into the woods, where they quickly become lost.
- The lights are in fact will o’ wisps that live in the moss, and feed off anything, including flesh.

### 7. Froyim’s Home
- **Froyim** makes his home here. He is a well-respected merchant in these parts.
- Behind the unusually  modern cottage  is a small garden. A large tree sits in the Northwest corner.
- Upon arrival, the PCs will find the door smashed open and blood splattered everywhere.
- **Froyim’s** body is in the back garden, torn to shreds.
- Hiding within the tree's mossy bark is a **Shtekn Folk** spy, which will try to run away (towards **Blue Forest**).

### 8. The Sefirot
