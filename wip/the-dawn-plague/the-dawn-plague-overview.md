# The Dawn Plague Overview

## Summary
- See the overland [map](/wip/the-dawn-plague/maps/the-dawn-plague-map.jpg).
- Khelma is a small village seated between a thick forest and a restless sea.
- Devastated by something called "The Dawn Plague" decades before, the town has never fully recovered.
- The villagers keep to the old ways, carefully following ritual burial rites.  
- An outside lumber company has planted its stake in the local forest, and pays the town handsomely.
- Workers and their families have arrived, bringing with them their religion and customs.
- “Strange sightings” have raised tensions between the villagers and the new families.
- The local Rab and his congregation have resorted to an ancient practice meant to protect the town from both outsiders and potential threats. Their efforts may have summoned a far worse threat to the town, with dire consequences.


## The Dawn Plague
* Thirty-three years ago, a hunting party from **Khelma** froze to death  in the **Blue Forest**. A passing Dybbuk happened upon their corpses and feasted.
* At dawn the next day, the party rose from the dead as Dybbuks as well. Mindlessly, they sought fresh meat.
* Eventually the new Dybbuks found the village of **Khelma**, leaving a trail of chewed-up animal corpses and despoiled graves.
* Locals began to take notice, though many were ill-equipped to handle the situation. A group consisting of all able-bodied adults attempted to stop the Dybbuks. All but one did not make it back.
* Those that were killed rose as Dybbuks at dawn the next day.  The survivor - a young seamstress - shared what she had learned. The Dybbuks _hated_ fire.
* The remaining residents (mostly the very young or very old) were able to frighten their former neighbors, parents and children with torches, pushing them into a nearby quarry.
* They then set it ablaze. This place is now referred to as **Orphan’s Mound**.
* Today the locals still stand vigilant for a full night after any burial, to ensure that none rise as a Dybbuk. They endlessly repeat the phrase, “A candle for one is a candle for a hundred.”

## Hooks
* PCs are hired by a wealthy outsider, sent to quiet the unrest.
* The PCs stumble upon the town in their travels, just as workers and villagers are coming to blows. A local clergy or city official may ask for their assistance as outsiders.
* Rumors of abandoned treasure buried beneath a large burial mound not far from town.

### Evidence of the Dybbuk’s Return
* Distrubed graves; mutilated animals. The sound of rocks moving in the forest.
* A gangly figure dressed in ragged clothing, seen only from afar.
* Last seen at the small abandoned cemetery North of town. Reports are unreliable.

## Monsters

### Dybbuk
10 HP,  12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, elongated claws (d6), jagged teeth (d8)
* Appear as grey-skinned, translucent humanoids with long snouts full of large, ugly teeth. Cannot interact with the world while in spirit form.
* Can leap into the living to wreak havoc among the living. Afterward it leaves only a soulless shell behind. Grows more powerful with each victim.
* Critical damage: target is immobilized. The wound turns fatal within 1d6 hours if not treated by a priest or skilled healer. If not burned, the victim will become a host for the Dybbuk.

### Root Witch
8 HP, 9 STR, 16 DEX, 14 WIL, tuber-fingers (d6)
* Excellent tunneler that hides underground near water. Wiggles tiny fronds into the air as lures.
* Above-ground, appears vaguely humanoid with the face of a rotted tree stump.
* Will exchange rare minerals for a “fresh corpse” of any kind.
* Easily takes offense, especially if offered anything more than a few days dead.
* Critical damage: target is pulled underground, where they soon suffocate.

### Golem
16 HP, 2 Armor, 15 STR, 6 DEX, 2 WIL, cobblestone fists (d10)
* A hulking 9’ tall statue made of clay, mud, and prayer.
* Mindlessly follows whatever commands given by its master, even after their death.
* Immune to mundane blades and missile weapons. Damage from fire is _enhanced_.
* If destroyed, the Golem eventually reforms and carries out its previous orders.
* Uttering the inverse of the spell that created it reduces the Golem to mud.

### Shtekn Folk
4 HP, 1 Armor, 11 STR, 8 DEX, 14 WIL, knotted fists (d8+d8)
- Stick-like humanoids made of branches, vines and roots. Refer to themselves as "the People".
- Never leave the **Blue Forest**. Regularly eavesdrop on "Flesh Folk" through tree-linking.
- Will trade almost anything for information they don't already have.
- Can approximate speech through undulating their twig-like fingers.
- Attacks utilizing fire are _enhanced_ against **Shtekn Folk**.

## 1. First Light
* The oldest established homestead, now home to siblings who remember the **Dawn Plague**.
* The elderly couple trade mostly in candles, some of which can ward undead.
* A **Dybbuk** haunts the farm, but will not touch the elderly couple, as they are its children.

## 2. Shorehead Ruins
* A large, mostly worn-away temple that predates the arrival of the **Khelma** colonists.
* Some theorize they represent ancient sea-faring peoples from across the **Silver Sea**.
*

## 3. The Tentyard
* Three structures lined in rows along the beach. They look like the ribs of a massive sea creature.
* A tarp is draped across one of the ribs. In the shade below, **Aroys-Geben** makes his home.
* He lives off fish and whatever trade he can find. He is also a spy for both the **Meyster** and **Gehilts**.

## 4. Khelma
* A dozen rustic-looking wooden buildings form a perfect square in the center.
* A massive old-growth forest dominates the lands to the East, split by a small mountain.
* On the North side dozens of farms spill out along a long, dusty road. The road bends Northwest.

### Optional Hook
- When the PCs arrive, a group of 10 locals (identifiable by their drab clothing) are about to come to blows with 5 obviously foreign lumber workers.

### Meyster's Office
- A box-like wooden building that was clearly renovated quite recently. Carefully studying the facade reveals it was formerly a butcher's shop.
- **Meyster Zeydne** often naps here at lunch; otherwise the place is usually empty.
- The room is bare save for a small desk and comfortable chair. The desk is shut with a simple lock.
- Within is an unsigned document detailing an agreement that would hand over management of the village to the **Gehilts Lumber Company**. The signer would receive 20% of future lumber profits.
- The symbol of protection (an eye) is emblazoned on the surface of the drawer, beneath the paperwork.

### The Schul
- The oldest building in town, standing in stark contrast to the newer construction.
- The ground before the doorway is sprinkled with white flour. If a demon crosses the threshold, its footsteps appear as if a chicken made them.
- The temple within is musty and in dire need of repair. Dual rows of broken wooded seats line a cracked central causeway, which ends at a small stone platform taking up much of the opposite half.
- In the Southwest corner is an attached study where **Rab Shlomo** studies as well as sleeps.
- A mechanism in the study controls the stone platform, causing it to recede into the wall. A staircase leads down into **The Tomb**.

## 5. Orphan's Mound
* A mass-burial site for those that died of the **Dawn Plague**.
* Tended by the **Gravedigger**, **Khelma’s** dead are brought here and burned.
* There is a **Root Witch** here, drawn by earth-tremblings from the Rab's research.
* **Gravedigger’s Hovel**: a paltry shack just next to the mound. **Kivyer** lives there.

## 6. The Blue Forest
* A thick, moss-covered forest of spruce, fir and maple trees. The forest is quite cold.
* At night, faint blue lights guide travelers deep into the woods, where they quickly become lost.
* The lights are in fact will o’ wisps that live in the moss, and feed off anything, including flesh.
* The bodies of frozen travelers from decades before still litter the forest, their belongings preserved in moss and frost.

## 7. Froyim’s Home
* **Froyim Greydinger** makes his home here. He is a well-respected merchant in these parts.
* Behind the unusually  modern cottage  is a small garden. A large tree sits in the Northwest corner.
* The **Dybbuk’s** first victim, as he travels frequently between his home and the coast.
* Upon arrival, the PCs will find the door smashed open and blood splattered everywhere.
* **Froyim’s** body is in the back garden, torn to shreds. If not burnt, it will rise as a **Dybbuk** at dawn.
* Hiding within the tree's mossy bark is a **Shtekn Folk** spy, which will try to run away (towards **Blue Forest**).

## 8. The Tomb
