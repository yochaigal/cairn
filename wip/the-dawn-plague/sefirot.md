# Sefirot

## Details throughout:
- Letters carved above each doorway, indicating the room's function and spiritual value.
- The smell of dried mud, decay and burnt-out candles.
- The walls of most rooms are made of earthen clay.

## Upper Level
### 1. Pedestal (**The Crown**)
- The stairs from the **Schul** descend into a central hub.
- A broken circle stands on a pedestal.
- **South**: Mostly blocked up by brackish mud. No light pours through the cracks on top.  
- **West** to the **Inner Chamber**, walls lined with words; a swirling maelstrom of letters.
- **East** to the **Courtyard**, the smell of dead flowers; the sounds of rushing water.

### 4. Inner chamber (**Understanding**)
- The walls are painted a vibrant green; the room smells like smoke.
- A workshop crammed with desks and tools. Some of the tables are filled with miniature, half-built golems.
- It is difficult to move around without pushing the furniture around (and making a lot of noise in the process).
- A highly detailed human brain is skillfully etched onto the cavern wall. Below the diagram is a small bucket filled with grubby water and some drawing tools.
- Stairs on the **South** side go to the **Outer Chamber**
- **South-West** to the **Treasury**

### 3. Courtyard (**Wisdom**)
- The walls are painted blue. Silence reigns.
- A fountain, dead & filled with refuse
- A statue with both male and female components?
- Water vein on the South-side floor leads to the **Pool of Life**
- **South-West** stairs lead to the **Treasury**

## Lower Level
### Outer Chamber (**Discipline**)
- The walls here are painted red
- Refuse pit to courtyard
- A dais. Symbols of ritual/rites; judgment.

### Pool of Life (**Kindness**)
- Whirlpool (rushing waters)
- Aquae Vitae (trap/puzzle)
- Wooden poles & parchment

### Burial Chamber (****)
-

## Bottom Level
### Treasury (**Beauty**)
- A chamber of souls
- Dybbuks
- Gold statue of man/thing in deep pool of water.
- Statue is missing man turned to gold.
- Water turns anything it touches to gold

### The Shrine **Splendor**
-
- **East** to **Victory**
- **Southeast** to the **Engine Room**
-

### (**Victory**)
-

### The Engine Room (**Foundation**)
- **[Alukah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alukah)** is here, feeding off souls.

### Throne Room (**Kingship**)
- The Golem is here.

## Multiple Entrances/Exits
- One entrance is beneath a rotating platform in the **Schul** (the pedestal)
- Another entrance via the **Orphan's Mound**

## Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

## Levels
- the **The Crown** (upper level), entrance from the **Schul**. Gradual descent from two different staircases
- Western staircase: the inner chamber (second level)
- Eastern Staircase: burial chamber (second level); has a vertical shaft leading from it and down into the outer chamber
- the outer chamber + tombs

## Have loops

## Have a lot of verticality

## Create secret areas/zones

## Variety in Room types

## Tactically useful areas

## Spying opportunities

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## ideas:
- Trap: an obvious painting on the ground/wall of whatever trap is behind it. Pressure tears the canvas, triggering the trap.
- False wells
- Head wires above tombs
- Powders that are inhaled
- Failed golems
- mercury addiction
