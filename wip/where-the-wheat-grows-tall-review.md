# Where The Wheat Grows Tall Review

## Notes
- The list of recommended damage dice for all the different farm implements is useful, because obviously that's what players are going to go for.
- The Running This Adventure page offers hooks and "running out of time" or "one shot" options. GOOD.
- The Bestiary upfront is very helpful, and allows the other pages to breathe.
- The stats are sparse and lean heavily on the flavor text, which makes conversion easier.
- The "other names" of monsters are quite interesting.
- Many of the spirits seem to react strongly against would-be attackers, but do not appear noticeably warlike otherwise. Defensive stats over offensive.
- I wish there was more evidence of past actions in the farmstead itself, or information about its location.
- Play aids were very helpful.
- Windvane concept is WONDERFUL.
- Locations of NPCs are very helpful.
- Lots of flipping around because of information design. Not bad for online play.
