## What creature is your specialty? Roll 1d6:

|       |               |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Arachnids** | Take a **Quick-Flame Rod** and an **Oil Can** (6 uses). It can destroy a large spider nest in seconds.                                                                            |
| **2** | **Felines**   | Take a sack of **Whiskerwort**. Its odor can calm and control even the largest of cats.                                                                                           |
| **3** | **Canines**   | Take a wreath of **Wolfsbane** and a **Large Net**. Effective against werewolves as well.                                                                                         |
| **4** | **Birds**     | Take a **Warble-Whistle** (3 charges). It can imitate any bird call, and can even be used to send simple messages. **Recharge**: Feed a baby bird as its mother would, then blow. |
| **5** | **Rodents**   | Take a **Pan Flute** that emits a high-pitched sound that only rodents can hear. So long as you play, they will follow. Even to their deaths.                                     |
| **6** | **Serpents**  | Take a **Warming Stone** that generates an irresistible heat, and a vial of **Antitoxin** (2 uses).                                                                               |


## What have you learned from the creatures of the wild? Roll 1d6: 

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | That there is far more to the world than meets the eye. With quiet concentration, you can borrow the senses of a nearby creature of your **specialty**.                                       |
| **2** | That the behavior of beasts is a language in itself. When observing beasts of your **specialty**, you gain insight into weather patterns and impending disasters.                             |
| **3** | That the pulse of the hunt is a powerful impulse. You have a sense for when predators, even those **not of your specialty**, are near.                                                        |
| **4** | That the land is a language unto itself. Your chance of becoming lost in a terrain dominated by the beasts of your **specialty** is reduced by one step (e.g. 4-in-6 becomes 3-in-6).             |
| **5** | That nature's symphony can be heard if you attune to its rhythm. When surrounded by creatures of your **specialty** they can alert you to approaching danger before it arrives.               |
| **6** | That survival is all about adaptability. Once per day, you may take on a simple feature from a creature of your **speciality** (webbed fingers, night vision, etc.). Add a **Fatigue** each time. |
