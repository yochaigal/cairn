## What drove you from caring for the dead? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Overburdened** |      |
| 2    |**Intoxicated** |      |
| 3    |**Witness** | Shadowy, inhuman figures interrupted the private burial of a wealthy noble, taking the corpse and murdering participating gentry. You were left alive to bare witness, but fled for fear of reprisal. Later, you found a **crow-shaped token** in your pocket. Squeezing it bridges the spirits of the dead. Once per day, you may ask a fresh corpse three questions, and receive answers in return. The dead do not necessarily speak the truth. |
