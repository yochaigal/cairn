## How did you earn your bow? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **War**. If you are first to attack, your bow gains the _blast_ property for the first round.                                                                                                        |
| **2** | **Falconry**. You keep a falcon [3 hp, 5 STR, 16 DEX, 4 WIL, claws (d6+d6), bite (d6)]. It only eats live game.                                                                                      |
| **3** | **Hunting**. When taking the [**Supply**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#supply) action your ability to secure **Rations** increases by **one step** (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6).    |
| **4** | **Tournaments**. Attacks with your bow are _enhanced_ if the target is immobile.                                                                                                                     |
| **5** | **Training**. If you are the first to attack, melee attacks against you are _impaired_ until you take STR damage.                                                                                    |
| **6** | **Scouting**. When taking the [**Travel**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel) action, your presence decreases the chance of getting lost by one step (e.g. 4-in-6 becomes 3-in-6).    |

## What kind of wood is your bow made from? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                          |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Western Yew** (d6, _bulky_). Can be wielded as a blunt weapon (d6). Noisy.                             |
| **2** | **Sessile Oak** (d8, _bulky_). Slams into targets. On **Critical Damage** something is torn off.        |
| **3** | **Stone Pine** (d6, _bulky_). Produces one use of **Sticky Sap** per day. It is highly explosive.      |
| **4** | **White Ash** (d6, _bulky_). Can be used in place of a shield in melee combat (+1 Armor).                |
| **5** | **Striped Bamboo** (d6). Collapsible, it only requires one slot (but still requires both hands).    |
| **6** | **Wych Elm** (d6, _bulky_). Protects the bearer from poisons and toxins, so long as they are holding it. |
