## What kind of wood is your bow made from? Roll 1d6:

|       |              |
| ----- | ------------ |
| **1** | **Western Yew** (d6, _bulky_). Can be wielded as a blunt weapon (d6). Noisy.     |
| **2** | **Sessile Oak** (d8, _bulky_). Slams into targets. On **critical damage**, something is torn off.     |
| **3** | **Smoothbark Hickory** (d6, _blast_, _bulky_). Fires multiple shots.  |
| **4** | **White Ash** (d6, _bulky_). Can be used in place of a shield in melee combat (+1 Armor).    |
| **5** | **Silverstripe Bamboo** (d6). Collapsible, it only requires one slot (still requires both hands). |
| **6** | **Wych Elm**. (d6, _bulky_). Protects the bearer from poisons and toxins, so long as they are holding it.    |
