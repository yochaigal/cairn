## How was your fraud exposed? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Your "patients" kept reporting miraculous recoveries, surprising you as much as the local authorities. When they investigated your credentials, you ran. Start with **bandages** and a knack for healing. |
| **2** | After seducing a wealthy patron, their family hired a criminal gang to retrieve you. You escaped but need to lay low for a while. Start with a scroll of _Charm_. |
| **3** | You peddled fake prophesies, until one turned out to be true, drawing unwanted attention. Roll on the **Omens** table but keep the result to yourself. If someone wants you dead, you always know about it.  |
| **4** | When your latest stunt destroyed a priceless artifact and left a dozen injured you were forced to fake your own death (again). Start with a **captain's uniform**, a **ceremonial sword** (harmless, _bulky_, 60gp), and a **bouquet of flowers** (_petty_ if smashed). |
| **5** | You have a knack for sleight of hand magic, passing it off as the real thing. Eventually you crossed paths with a hedgewitch, who cursed you for it. You "set off" nearby magic, often in unpredictable ways. Interacting with Relics or Spellbooks requires a WIL save to avoid disaster. If you are the target of either the same applies to its source. |
| **6** | Your "seances" with the dead were in actuality a ruse involving a cleverly hidden spellbook of _Raise Spirit_. Inevitably a patron discovered your secret and uncovered your ruse. You fled with the **spellbook**, a bundle of scarves, and a knack for showmanship. |

## What keepsake could always identify you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                    |                                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Royal Crest**                    | Born into royalty, you chose a different life The crest grants you access, but also alerts your family of your whereabouts. |
| **2** | **World-Famous Miracle Oil**       | A smelly concoction inherited from a family member. You can't bring yourself to rid of it. It is very, very, slippery. |
| **3** | **Surgeon's Soap**                 | A lye and ash block that makes skin transparent, revealing the anatomy within. 4 uses. |
| **4** | **Goat Powder**                    | Derived from the placenta of a baby goat.  Temporarily cures any affliction, but symptoms return within hours. |
| **5** | **Cursed Sapphire**                | Valued at around 200gp, it returns to your pocket each time you spend it You can't seem to get rid of it. |
| **6** | **Alchemical Tattoo**              | A mundane house pet that leaps off your body whenever you wish, and follows your command. It can pass injuries back onto you.    |
