## What got the better of you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                         |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A voracious swarm of pests that swallowed crops and animals alike. With nothing to defend, you left. Take **Gale Seed Extract** (3 uses).  Ingesting it lets you sprint with a speed four times your regular rate. Afterward you add two **Fatigue**.        |
| **2** | A crop spirit, angered by a poor tithing. The fires consumed nearly everything, and afterwards you were able to gather a pouch of **Fireseeds** (d8, _blast_, 4 uses).        |
| **3** | An antlered, toothy demon that nearly ended you. Take a blood-stained **Bone Knife** (d6). On **Critical Damage**, its next attack becomes _enhanced_ from contact with blood. |
| **4** | _The Withering_, a type of stem rot from the **Roots**. Take a **Diseased Crop** (6 uses) that quickly decays any plant it touches.                        |
| **5** | Wolves, or so you thought. You are now a **Werewolf** [8 HP, 15 STR, 14 DEX, claws (d6+d6) or bite (d8)]. Your WIL remains the same. You can _turn_ at will (once per day) but must make a WIL save to revert. Anyone left alive from your attacks must make a WIL save to avoid infection. |
| **6** | Crop thieves. Not all of them survived, but you were outnumbered. Take a +d4 HP and a **Hilted Broadsword** (d8).  |

## What tool saved your life? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Bloodvine Whip** | d8 damage. On **Critical Damage**, it drains the target's blood, granting the weapon's next attack the _blast_ quality             |
| **2** | **Clatter Keeper** | A hand-cranked device that emits a loud noise, frightening away most creatures.                                                               |
| **3** | **Sun Stick**      | Provides ample warmth and light for up to one hour. **Recharge**: Leave in heavy sunlight for a full day. 1 use. |
| **4** | **Root Tether**    | When thrown, binds a creature as large as a wolf to the soil for a short time.                                                                        |
| **5** | **Greenwhistle**   | A small flute that calms plants, making passage through areas heavy with plant life a bit easier.                                                   |
| **6** | **Everbloom Band** | A circlet adorned with flowers that never wilt. On **Critical Damage**, the flowers dissolve into dust, but you act as if your save succeeded (STR loss still occurs). |
