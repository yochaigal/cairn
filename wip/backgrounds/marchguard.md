| **1** | Your family has a long tradition of serving, and you were trained from an early age how to survive in the wilds. You can forgo **Sleep** for one night without penalty, and you find **d6** rations when taking the **Supply** action.|
| **2** | As a convict, you knew nothing of the Oath you were taking, only as a means of avoiding death. Take a **throwing knives** (d6, 3 uses)s, and the key to a safe hideout back home. |
| **3** | To escape family trouble. Take a **Goosefelt Tarp** (one slot), a gift of the Guard that brought you in. |

| **5** | Your life was saved by a member of the **Marchguard**, and you were inspired to join their ranks. Take a **snare kit** and a **sketchbook**. |
| **6** | When things weren't looking great, you figured life might be easier among others. You're still not so sure. Take an **oilskin coat** and **weatherproof mapping paper**. |
