|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Your family has a long tradition of serving, and you were trained from an early age on how to survive in the wilds. When taking the [**Supply**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#supply) action your yield increases by one step (e.g. 1d4 > 1d6). |
| **2** | As a convict, the Oath was simply a means of avoiding punishment. Take **Lockpicks**, and the key to a safehouse (_petty_).                                                                                                                                          |
| **3** | Noble-born, you joined to escape family trouble. Take a **Goosefelt Tarp** (fits two) that you stole before leaving home.                                                                                                                                           |
| **4** | When your family lost everything, you took the Oath to avoid becoming a burden. Take extra **Rations** (3 uses) and **Throwing Knives** (d6, 3 uses).                                                                                                               |
| **5** | Your life was saved by a member of the **Marchguard**, and you were inspired to join their ranks. Take a **Snare Trap** and a **Sketchbook** filled with detailed drawings.                                                                                         |
| **6** | You were in a dark place, and decided that your life needed a little direction. You're still not so sure it was the right choice. Take an **Oilskin Coat** and **Mapping Paper**.                                                                                   |

## What do you carry as proof of your Oath?

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Impressive Pin** | A metal badge of honor from the Guard. It can open doors, but leaves a trail.                                                                                            |
| **2** | **Oath Compass**   | Points not towards North, but instead to the nearest member of the Guard. It also lets you know when they're getting close.                                              |
| **3** | **Pullstones**     | Two jet-black stones. When separated, the stones will always roll in the direction of the other.                                                                         |
| **4** | **Fireflask**      | Highly alcoholic, but strangely delicious. When lit, creates a short-living wall of flames 10ft high.                                                                    |
| **5** | **Pain Band**      | Touch an injured creature to transfer their wounds to you (exchange their lost STR with your own). **Recharge**: Wear the ring while in perfect health. It will take 1 STR, permanently. |
| **6** | **Poacher's Woe**  | Strongly-scented arrows (3 uses). The scent is powerful enough to track with ease.                                                                                       |
