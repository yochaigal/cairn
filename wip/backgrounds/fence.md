## How did you become a fence?

|      |                                                              |

| 1    | You started as a petty thief and slowly graduated to selling stolen goods. The thrill of the job and the connections you've made have kept you in the business. You know the best places to sell various types of items, and have contacts in the underworld. |
| 2    | A relative was a well-known fence, and you grew up learning the trade from them. You inherited their network of buyers and sellers, but you're still making a name for yourself. You're familiar with identifying the value of stolen goods and how to avoid getting caught. |
| 3    | You were a legitimate merchant who got involved in shady deals to make ends meet. Over time, you found the black market to be more lucrative and less regulated than legal trade. You've learned to spot forgeries and hidden compartments in objects. |
| 4    | You were once a skilled craftsman who lost everything in a fire or accident. Turning to a life of crime, you became a fence to survive, using your expertise in your trade to verify the authenticity of stolen items. You can appraise the value of items related to your former trade with great accuracy. |
| 5    | You were a member of a thieving guild that disbanded, leaving you to fend for yourself. You decided to use your connections and knowledge of the trade to become a fence, making it your business to connect buyers and sellers of stolen goods. You have a keen eye for spotting undercover law enforcement. |
| 6    | You stumbled upon a hidden stash of valuable goods and decided to sell them on the black market. The rush of the illicit trade drew you in, and you decided to make a living as a fence. You have a knack for finding hidden stashes and secret caches. |
