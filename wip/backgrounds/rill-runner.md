|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | _The Tinker's Two-Step_. A humorous fairy tale about a gift-giving traveler. Start with a **reed whistle**. Anyone in earshot must pass a WIL save to perform any act of violence.                                                       |
| **2** | _The Sylph and Her Lover_. A bawdy tale of lost love. Start with a **breeze knot** (3 charges). Use it to create a strong breeze. **Recharge**: Tie it to a mast during a storm.                                                         |
| **3** | _Harper's Hollow_. A sad, short tale about a musician that falls in love with a star. Start with a **lunar lute**. Reveals the constellations above, no matter the weather.                                                              |
| **4** | _The Reed Fisher_. A celebrated tale of a fisher and a massive carp. Begin with a spool of **river twine** (5 uses). Each dip into the river guarantees a catch, though it's not always pleasant.                                        |
| **5** | _Song of the Silver Stream_. A wordless lullaby that mimics flowing water. Take a **stone flute** that can calm any river waters in earshot.                                                                                             |
| **6** | _The Thrush and the Meadow_. A moody tale told in alternating chorus. Start with a **feather quill** (1 use, _petty_). A map drawn with this quill reveals the most expedient course from any two points. |
