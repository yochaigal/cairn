|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | _The Tinker's Two-Step_. A humorous fairy tale about a gift-giving traveler. Start with a **Reed Whistle**. Anyone in earshot must pass a WIL save to perform an act of violence.                                                       |
| **2** | _The Sylph and Her Lover_. A bawdy tale of lost love. Start with a **Breeze Knot** (3 charges). Creates a strong breeze. **Recharge**: Tie it to a mast during a storm.                                                         |
| **3** | _Harper's Devotion_. A sad, short tale about a musician that falls in love with a star. Start with a **Celestial Lute**. Reveals the constellations above, no matter the weather.                                                              |
| **4** | _The Reed Fisher_. A celebrated song about a massive carp that always seems to get away. Begin with a spool of **River Twine** (5 uses). Each dip into the river guarantees a catch, though it might not be pleasant.                              |
| **5** | _Song of the Silver Stream_. A wordless lullaby that mimics flowing water. Take a **Stone Flute** that can calm almost any river.                                                                                             |
| **6** | _The Thrush and the Meadow_. A moody tale told in alternating chorus. Start with a **Feather Quill** (1 use, _petty_). A map drawn with this quill reveals the most expedient course between any two points. |

| **1** | **Performance**     | Performing at taverns always yields both room and board. Sometimes you even get tips! Start with an extra **10gp**.                          |
| **2** | **Bodyguard**       | You are a protector for those afraid to travel alone. Start with a **Rapier** (d8).                                                          |
| **3** | **Wares**           | You buy low and sell high, always making just enough to get by. Take a **single item** worth **20gp** (or less) from the [gear](/wip/2e/marketplace#gear) table.                              |
| **4** | **Transport**       | You deliver "delicate" packages throughout the lands. You have at least one contact in any major town.                                        |                                                    
| **5** | **Sailor's Friend** | Whether water, wind, or sail, your aid brings ships to their destination. For you, passage is always free.  |
| **6** | **Guide**           | You shephard caravans and travelers across water-soaked lands. Start with an extra **10gp** and a **map** (_petty_) relevant to your next journey. |
