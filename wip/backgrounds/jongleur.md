|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Despite your training in the deadly arts, an actor died and you were blamed. Take a light-weight **Rapier** (d6) and a false identity.                                                                                                                 |
| **2** | The crowd loved your catchy tune about a noble and his romantic failings. The noble in question, not so much. Take the _Read Mind_ **Spellbook** and a warrant for your arrest.                                                                        |
| **3** | Your debut composition reduced the audience to a gibbering mess, murmuring of bright creatures descending from the night sky. Later you noticed that the notes resembled stellar constellations. Take a **Book On Astronomy**, and a lot of questions. |
| **4** | You mocked a forgotten trickster god, and were cursed for it. You speak only in perfect rhyme. Ironically, this has only made you more popular among your peers. Take a **Thesaurus** (20gp). Without it you are _deprived_.               |
| **5** | You were scarred in an on-stage accident. The crowd cheered, thinking it was part of the act. Take well-worn **Stage Mail** (1 Armor), a memorable scar, and a fear of applause.                                                                       |
| **6** | Your respectable puppeteering skills were matched only by your mimicry. You were so good you were branded a witch (literally) and banished. Take an **Uncanny Hand-Puppet** and a **Rabbit Skull** (_petty_, sewn with grass) that protects against charms.     |

## What trinket were you unable to leave behind? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **False Cuffs**    | Comfortable, realistic-looking cuffs. Only you know the trick to get out of them.                                    |
| **2** | **Pocket Theatre** | A set of small puppets and folding stage. Good for quick distractions.                                               |
| **3** | **Ghost Violin**   | A dark grey violin that plays a haunting tune, mirrored by an invisible, distant twin.                               |
| **4** | **Tragic Tales**   | Banned in proper company, it becomes less bawdy and more harrowing towards the end. Worth **100gp**.                      |
| **5** | **Mythos Mask**    | A plaster mask that allows one to take on a monster's countenance. Once it comes off, add a **Fatigue**. |                                                              
| **6** | **Rebreak Glass**  | A wine flute that can be broken multiple times, reforming after 24 hours. Makes a really loud noise.                  |
