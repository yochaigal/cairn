| **2** | You were tasked with delivering a highly important message to a far-off land. Take a **sealed scroll**. Roll on the **Bonds** table.                                                                                                   |
| **3** | A fellow scribe was accused of heresy, and you must clear their name. Take their banned **tome of forbidden knowledge** (d8). Roll on the **Bonds** table.                                                                             |
| **4** | Your library was burned to the ground, and you're seeking revenge. Take a **charred page** from a once-great book.  Roll on the **Omens** table.                                                                                       |
| **5** | You stumbled upon a prophecy that seems to be unfolding before your very eyes. Take a **collection of prophetic verses**. Roll on the **Omens** table.                                                                                 |
| **6** | You were falsely accused of forgery and expelled from your order. You aim to redeem yourself. Take a **forged royal decree**. Roll on the **Bonds** table.                                                                             |

## What tool of your trade do you always carry? Roll 1d6:

|       |                         |                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **1** | **Ink of Truth**        | Ink that glows when used to write true statements, but fades if used to write falsehoods.                                                                          |
| **2** | **Cipher Stone**        | A stone with a complex grid of symbols used to encode and decode secret messages.                                                                                  |
| **3** | **Everquill**           | A quill that never runs out of ink and can write on any surface, even stone or metal.                                                                              |
| **4** | **Scroll of the Winds** | A scroll that, when unfurled, can create a strong gust of wind, useful for dispersing smoke or distracting foes.                                                   |
| **5** | **Memory Vial**         | A small vial that, when filled with ink, can store a person's memories for later retrieval.                                                                        |
| **6** | **Tome of Echoes**      | A seemingly empty book that, when opened, whispers the words of the last written work the reader touched. Useful for eavesdropping or remembering important texts. |
