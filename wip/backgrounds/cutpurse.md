## What was your last big job? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A noble's summer home. The place was full of fancy wine (+20gp) but not much else. Take **Fence Cutters**.                                              |
| **2** | A bank (you were caught). You bear a brand only visible by firelight, and anyone that sees the mark can ask you for a beer. Take **Retractable Wires**. |
| **3** | A guild warehouse. Take a **Ladder** (_bulky_, 10ft) and **Blinding Powder** (1 use).                                                                           |
| **4** | Moneylender. Someone beat you to the job, but left behind a **Scroll** of _Arcane Eye_ (_petty_).                                                                 |
| **5** | Constable's quarters. You escaped, but left some friends behind. Take **Strong Silk Rope** (30ft) and a queasy feeling.                                        |
| **6** | A university. You were seen, but not pursued. You still don't know why. Take **Smoke Pellets** (3 uses).                                                |

## What helps you steal? Roll 1d6:

|       |                   |                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Catring**       | 2 charges. Climb up walls and fall silently. **Recharge**: Place the ring on a stray cat's tail.                                                   |
| **2** | **Gildfinger**    | 1 charge. A finger glove that mimics any mundane key. **Recharge**: bundle it with at least 100gp for a night.                                        |
| **3** | **Glimpse Glass** | 3 charges. A monocle that lets you see through walls or other obstructions. It shatters after the last use.                                        |
| **4** | **Sweetwhistle**  | 1 charge. Listeners hear a soft, familiar voice in the distance that they cannot resist following. **Recharge**: Lose a dear memory (describe it). |
| **5** | **Sack of Lies**  | Pull out a convincing lie appropriate to whatever situation you're in. For the rest of the day, you cannot lie.                                    |
| **6** | **Spider Gloves** | _Bulky_. Heavy gloves that allow you to climb walls with ease. They take a few minutes to remove, and can only be worn for short periods.     |
