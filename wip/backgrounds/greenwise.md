## Starting Gear

- Iron pot
- Root knife (d6)
- Healing salve (restore 4 STR)
- Twine bauble (_petty_, _Ward_ once per day)
_Ward_: A silver circle 50ft across appears on the ground. Choose one species that cannot cross it.

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | An ill-tempered forest spirit cursed you for stealing, marking you as an enemy of their kind. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. Ingesting it cures any poison (1 use, unless retrieved).             |
| **2** | A close friend, swallowed whole. Now you see their face in any tea you brew. Take a **Soporific Concoction** (3 uses).                                                                                 |
| **3** | You were poisoned, losing your sense of taste and smell. You can now withstand noxious fumes, and always carry **Antitoxin** (2 uses).                                                        |
| **4** | Your radical experiments turned your skin green, and you now gain nourishment as a plant. You don't need **Rations**, but a day without sufficient sunlight and water leaves you _deprived_. |
| **5** | Your impressive corpseflower won a local contest, then promptly killed a judge. You fled, but not without the **Prize Money (100gp)** and a warrant for your arrest.                    |
| **6** | You created a restorative tincture that also caused accidental infertility. Take a **Healing Potion** that completely restores STR. Only you know of its unintended side-effects.                       |
