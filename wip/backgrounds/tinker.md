## How did your lose your way?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Accomplice** | A well-respected tinsmith, your skill attracted the attention of a wealthy patron who offered you a year's pay to design a miniscule part from spec. You learned later that your handiwork was was found in a vault-cracking device used by the **Guild of Thieves, Scoundrels and Wastrels**, your signature scrived within. Your property seized, you fled to avoid imprisonment (or worse). You always carry pincers, a hammer, and tin. Given time and materials, you can open almost any door. |
| 2    |**Persecuted** | You made a living traveling from town to town, selling home goods, tools, and the like. You didn't stuck around long enough to make friends, but enemies seemed to pop-up almost everywhere: superstitious peasants, greedy nobles, or wicked zealots. Some whispered on the devilish origins of your people, while others simply made your kind a bogeymen for their daily ills. Eventually it became too dangerous to keep up the family trade, so you found a new path for yourself. You start with a  hidden stiletto (0 slots), a lantern, and oil. You are fluent in the *Traveller's Cant* and its signs; if there is a city within 3 days' walk, you can always find it. |
| 3    |**Peace** | Your folk were smelters, taking raw mineral and making it stronger, more flexible. And during the war, bronze was in high demand - as were your services. But once the war ended, so did your family's livelihood. You and your seven siblings split what was left and spread across the lands in search of the next profitable mineral beneath the earth's crust. Take a smelting hammer (d10, bulky) and . Given time and adequete materials, you can repair or even *augment* armor, increasing its strength and resiliency. You can identify refined metals and their properties.  |
| 4    |**Ignorance** | You sold only the most rare or unique items: scholarly books, scientific tools, and mechanical wonders. Monasteries and religious houses were once your most important customer, before the inquisition, before the demon trials took over the countryside. You escaped with what little you could grab, and deep down you know the witchfinders are still hunting for you. Take a spyglass, and the [Fold Portal](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#fold-portal) spellbook.     |
| 5    |**Comfort** |  You aren't a tinker, not really. You don't have a head for numbers, or a heart for the sale. Your skill lay instead in the art of self-defense, of killing. You'd travel to and fro with the tinker's, protecting their wares and keeping their company. In time they became like family to you. But you became too comfortable, and let your guard down when it really counted. Your caravan was robbed and someone close to you was killed. Now they're gone, and you're looking for work. You carry a long sword (d10, bulky) and wear a brigandine (1 Armor, bulky). |
| 6    |**Guilt** |  During the war you became nought more than a scavenger, scouring the bloody grasses and burning forests for tin and iron mere hours after the armies had moved out, the bodies of their soldiers sometimes still twitching and clinging on to life. The horrors you saw in the battlefields still haunt you to this day. After the war ended, you vowed never to dishonor the dead again, donating regular alms to funeraries and their ilk. Start with a donkey (+4 slots, slow), a crossbow (d8 damage, bulky), holy water, a saw, and a debt you can never repay.       |

## What do you keep near that never fails to get you out of trouble?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Fire Eggs** | Six small pellets made of sea salt, wood, and crockery-dust. They explode at low heat (d8, _blast) but dissipate quickly.      |
| 2    |**Black Tar** | Useful while carting your goods on the long lonely roads between towns. Especially if you're being followed.    |
| 3    |**Spiked Boots** | Cracks heads as easily as it does ice and muck (d8). Travel is also a bit slower, but easier.     |
| 4    |**Tinker's Paste** | Seals shut any fist-sized opening. 3 uses.     |
| 5    |**Younger Sibling** | Create another character, but follow the [hireling](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#hirelings) rules. They share your background, and will follow you to the ends of the earth. You are not necessarily related. |
| 6    |**Riding Horse** | This powerful steed (hooves, d6) is fast and can carries you +2 slots of goods as far as you wish. You must feed it one ration a day. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt is to....
**Her Majesty's Royal Archivists**. After a nasty outbreak of lich-lords beneath one of the city's most hallowed buildings, your party were brought in to clean up the mess. You succeeded, but the resulting damage to the priceless artifacts in the crypts below was not appreciated by her lordship. By royal decree you must pay 500 gold pieces within the season, or suffer the consequences. Take holy water and two spellbooks: [Curse Unlife](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#curse-unlife) and [Lichsense](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#lichsense).
