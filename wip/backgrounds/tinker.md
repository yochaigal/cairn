|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 1   | A machine you designed was later used open a wealthy noble's vault. Now the constables are after you, and the **Guild of Thieves, Scoundrels and Wastrels** is asking for a percentage of the stolen goods. You always carry pincers, a hammer, and tin. Given time and materials, you can open almost any door.                                                  |
| 2   | Formerly a traveling merchant dealing in home goods and tools, the hostility and superstition of townspeople pushed you towards new horizons. You are armed with a hidden **stiletto**, a **lantern**, and **oil**. You are fluent in the _Traveller's Cant_, and can always find a city within a three-day walk.                                                 |
| 3   | Formerly a military smelter, peace destroyed your livelihood. Now you roam in search of profitable minerals only found deep under ground. Take a **smelting hammer** (d10, bulky). You can identify most metals and understand their properties. Given time and adequete materials, you can even repair armor.                                                    |
| 4   | You traded only in the most rare and sought-after items, selling to monastaries and nobles alike. Then the inquisitions swept the lands, followed soon after by trials. You escaped with only what you could carry. Take a **spyglass**, a **necklace** (petty) worth 20gp, and the [Fold Portal](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#fold-portal) spellbook.     |
| 5   | Not a true metalsmith, your skill lay in the art of self-defense. You protected the trade, quietly watching for threats as gold exchanged hands. One day your caravan was robbed and your ward was killed. You survived, but were banned from service. You start with +d4 HP, and carry a **long sword** (d10, bulky) and a **brigandine** (1 Armor, bulky). |
| 6   | You scavenged bloody battlefields for tin and iron, pulling teeth from still-twitching corpses. After the war, you vowed never again to dishonor the dead. Start with a **donkey** (+4 slots, slow), a **crossbow** (d8 damage, bulky), a **saw** (d6), and a debt you can never repay.                                                                           |

## What do you have that ever fails to get you out of trouble? Roll 1d6:

|     |                    |                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Fire Eggs**      | Six small pellets made of sea salt, wood, and crockery-dust. They explode at low heat (d8, _blast_) but dissipate quickly.        |
| 2   | **Black Tar**      | Useful while carting your goods on the long lonely roads between towns. Especially if you're being followed.                      |
| 3   | **Spiked Boots**   | Cracks heads as easily as it does ice and muck (d8). Travel is also a bit slower, but easier.                                     |
| 4   | **Tinker's Paste** | Seals shut any fist-sized opening. 3 uses.                                                                                        |
| 5   | **Fireworks**      | A dazzling, albeit dangerous display, with enough explosive material to blow off a finger. Or more. 2 uses remain.                |
| 6   | **Riding Horse**   | This powerful steed (hooves, d6) is fast and carries you +2 slots of goods as far as you wish. You must feed it one ration a day. |
