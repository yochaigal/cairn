## Why did you stop caring for the dead? Roll 1d6:

|     |               |                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | You hid as creatues of smoke and feather stole a noble's corpse and killed the mourners. Later, you found a **crow-shaped token** in your pocket. It lets you ask one question of the dead (take 1 Fatigue). The dead do not always speak truly. |
| **2** | You released a long-dormant **Revenant** from a forgotten tome. The experienced scarred you, and made you a pariah amongst the living. You no longer breathe, nor do you require food. Of course, you can still die, but the dead now see you as one of their own. |
| **3** | You fled a death cult after getting cold feet. Your (now undead) brethren are still in pursuit, and their master's power is growing by the day. Take a **Blood Pail** (_bulky_). Empty its contents to summon a creature built from items buried below (bones, rocks, pottery, etc). The **Shambler** [6 HP, 1 Armor, 13 STR, 11 DEX, 4 WIL, shard fists (d8)] obeys your command but if destroyed _permanently_ subtracts 1 STR. **Recharge**: Fill the bucket with the blood of the dying. |
| **4** | You tended to the family tomb as part of a failed heist that landed your friends in jail, and left you a fugitive. On the bright side, you escaped with the getaway **wagon** (+8 slots, slow) and a stubborn old **donkey** (+4 slots, slow). If attached to the wagon, the donkey only holds +2 slots. |
| **5** | Once part of a family that served an obscure underworld deity, you lost your faith but retained its teachings. Cast out, you were allowed to take the  [_Frozen Corpse_](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#frozen-corpse) spellbook with you, so that you may continue to serve, even as an apostate.
| **6** | Plague struck your village, filling the graveyard beyond capacity. Alone and heartbroken, you fled. Take a **Plague Doctor's Mask** to protect against disease and other airborne toxins. |

## What did you take from the deceased? Roll 1d6:

|     |               |                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Manacles**  | Old, but still pretty effective, even against the very strong. You don't have the key.                                                |
| 2   | **Sponge**    | Made of some incredible material, supposedly from an elusive sea creature. It never seems to get dry. Worth 50gp to the right person. |
| 3   | **Pulley**    | Great for heaving gravestones, rocks, or even bodies.                                                                                 |
| 4   | **Incense**   | Perfect for rituals, or to keep the flies at bay. Cools the blood.                                                                    |
| 5   | **Crowbar**   | Sometimes you just need to get the damn thing open!                                                                                   |
| 6   | **Repellent** | Powerful stuff. You're not sure what it is actually _meant_ to repell though, as the writing is faded. Perhaps everything. 3 uses.    |
