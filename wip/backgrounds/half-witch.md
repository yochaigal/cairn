## What did you bring back from the Unseelie Court? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A **Black Rose Fiddle** (_bulky_). Its music causes intense sadness and immobility in nearby mortals (others are merely fascinated). You don't know how to play.                                                                                              |
| **2** | **Paper legs**. You are extremely light, and can fall a few stories without getting hurt. Try to avoid tearing them or getting them wet.                                                                                                                                |
| **3** | A **Living Nightmare** that dwells within you, but manifests whenever you are in danger. It has your same **Attributes** and **HP**, and attacks with claws (d8+d8). It disappears on **Critical Damage** (take 1d4 WIL damage), re-appearing again on the next full moon. |
| **4** | A **Raven Familiar** [8 HP, 3 STR, 11 DEX, 13 WIL, beak, (d6)]. It speaks as an intelligent being and is entirely devoted to you.                                                                                                                             |
| **5** | A **Briar Thorn**. It can pierce any organic material (quite painfully) but when removed leaves no trace of the intrusion.                                                                                                                                    |
| **6** | A Fae creature's **True Name**. Use it to summon its owner for an act of great service, but only once. It could also fetch a hefty price, to the right buyer.                                                                                               |

## What concoction do you carry, and what rare ingredients did you gather to make it? Roll 1d6:

|       |                      |                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Rebirth Ash**      | Remnants of a bark spirit. Sprinkle to reignite a fire that has died, or return to life a creature that has died only moments before. 3 uses.                                  |
| **2** | **Glamour Feather**  | Plume of a firebird. Can make any creature appear convincingly as someone (or something) else. 1 use.                                                                         |
| **3** | **Hawthorn Seed**    | An acorn from the other side, gathered on the spring equinox. When planted it sprouts a luxurious shelter, collapsing at moonrise the next day. 1 use.                         |
| **4** | **Stonetree Sap**    | Sap obtained in exchange for blood. Hardens when rubbed on any surface (+1 Armor). 3 uses.        |
| **5** | **Nightdust Powder** | The ritual burning of six owls. When tossed in the air, day turns to night for a short while. 2 uses.                                                             |
| **6** | **Hex Stone**        | Gathered from a river that flows from the _other side_. Removed from its iron tin, it can absorb the effects of an active magical effect. If destroyed, the magic is released. 1 use. |
