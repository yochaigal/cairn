|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| **1** | You build small contraptions for local guilds (and don't ask too many questions). Take an extra 40gp and a wanted poster with your face on it. Given time and materials, _you can open almost any door or vault_.       |
| **2** | You deal in home goods and tools, hawking your wares to townspeople across the lands. Take 20gp worth of items from the [gear](/wip/2e/marketplace#gear) table. You are fluent in the _Traveller's Cant_.                  |
| **3** | You were a military smelter, before peace destroyed your livelihood. Take a **smelting hammer** (d10, _bulky_) and a **tin helm** (+1 Armor). Given time and adequate materials, _you can repair armor_.                       |
| **4** | You sell rare and quality items to monasteries and nobles alike. Take a **Spyglass**, a **Necklace** (_petty_) worth 20gp, and a **Scroll** of [Mirrorwalk](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#100-spells) (_petty_). |
| **5** | You offer protection as a service, quietly watching for threats as money exchanges hands. You start with **+d4 HP**, and carry a **Long Sword** (d10, _bulky_) and a **Brigandine** (1 Armor, _bulky_).                 |
| **6** | You scavenge raw tin and iron from battlefields, pulling teeth from still-twitching corpses. Start with a young **Donkey** (+4 slots, slow), a **Crossbow** (d8 damage, _bulky_), and a **Saw** (d6).                                   |

## What never fails to get you out of trouble? Roll 1d6:

|     |                    |                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Fire Eggs**      | Six small pellets made of sea salt, wood, and crockery-dust. They explode at low heat (d8, _blast_) but dissipate quickly.        |
| 2   | **Black Tar**      | Versatile: both sticky and highly flammable. 3 uses.          |
| 3   | **Spiked Boots**   | Cracks heads (d8) as easily as it does ice and muck. Travel is also a bit slower, but easier.                                     |
| 4   | **Tinker's Paste** | Seals shut any fist-sized opening. 3 uses.                                                                                        |
| 5   | **Fireworks**      | A dazzling, albeit dangerous display. Enough explosive material to blow off a finger or three. 2 uses remain.                |
| 6   | **Carrion Cat**   |  A clever pet, small enough to hide in your pack (_bulky_) but strong enough to scare off smaller predators. Requires one **Ration** a day, and it must be meat. |
