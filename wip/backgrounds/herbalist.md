## Why did you lose your passion for herbalism? Roll 1d6:

|      |                 |                                                              |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Tormented**   | You (accidentally?) stole the heart-seed of a cantankerous forest spirit; it still hounds you. Until such time as the spirit's ire is sated anything you plant will wilt and die. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. It can cure any wound, and even reverse death. One use. |
| 2    | **Haunted**     | You bore witness to the death of a close friend. Recently, you've been seeing their face in any teas you brew. They only speak of death; both theirs and yours. Take a soporific. You're quite good at making them, now.  |
| 3    | **Devil's Bargain**   | You spent years studying plants and herbs, hoping to find the cure for a life-long affliction. You were successful, but paid a great price: the loss of both your taste and smell. You can handle noxious fumes better than most. Take an authoritative book on dangerous plants.  |
| 4    | **Cross-pollination**    | Your experiments were radical, crossing boundaries you were never meant to surpass. You used yourself as a test subject, with dire consequences. You do not eat; the Sun provides enough nutrients, provided its rays reach you often enough. Instead of rations, you carry a jug of water.  |
| 5    | **Deadly Consequences** | The local nobility sponsored a grand competition between all the greatest herbalists, florists and gardeners. Your corpse-flower won the show. Unfortunately, it also killed one of the judges. Take the grand prize: 25gp, and the hatred of nearly everyone. |
| 6    | **Fall From Grace**    | Your restorative tinctures were known all through the lands, bringing you fame and fortune. That is of course until it was discovered that one of the side-effects was infertility. Take a healing potion; drinking restores all STR. You know the cost, though.    |

## What keepsake did you take with you? Roll 1d6:

|      |                       |                                                              |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Amadou**            | A peculiar kind of fungus that catches flame quite easily. You have about 6 uses worth. |
| 2    | **Delphinium**        | A gray, concentrated elixir that allows the drinker the ability to hold their breath for up to an hour. It can be divided into multiple doses.  |
| 3    | **Tacky Stalk**       | This woody reed contains a fibrous, chalky interior that may be chewed into a gummy mound. After a few minutes this mound will harden entirely, becoming a permanent adhesive after drying. It spreads well. |
| 4    | **Artificial Flowers** | A bouquet fashioned out of felt, wax, wire and other materials. It looks real as long as it is not closely observed, and is rather resplendent. Its odor resembles that of a person's favorite flower. |
| 5    | **Seed Bomb**         | Three dirt clods held tightly together in small canvas sacks. Their contents explodes on impact, showering their target with dirt and a multitude of seeds. |
| 6    | **Duda**          | A brownish root that looks almost like a tiny sleeping human. At first it fits snugly into your backpack, but comes alive when splashed with a bit of milk. Tell it where you (and only you) want to go, and suddenly you'll find yourself there. Each time it wakes it grows by a factor of two. |

## Debt
You trespassed over an invisible boundary maintained by the **Wooden Dead**, a faction of benign Forest Liches. They now demand you plant a new grove of rare (and expensive) corpsewood trees. Until this debt is paid, trees and plants wilt at your touch.
