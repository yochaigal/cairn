## What strange fungus did you discover? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Shrieking Trumpet**. When exposed to light, it screams so loudly that all nearby attacks (including your own) are _impaired_. 2 uses.                                        |
| **2** | **Torch Fungus**. When crushed, it creates a cold blue light for a short while. 2 uses.                                                                                        |
| **3** | **Murderous Truffle**. Pungent, highly toxic, and very rare (worth 50gp to assassins).  Illegal pretty much everywhere. 1 use.                                                 |
| **4** | **Hellcap**. Exposure to its aroma causes intense nausea and vomiting. Either way, it clears the room. Bottled (1 use).                                                        |
| **5** | **Sproutcup**. Ingest to shrink down to the size of a mouse. (Your belongings stay the same size.) You return to normal size within the hour, often in fits and starts. 1 use. |
| **6** | **Rootflower**. A white fungus found only on corpses deep underground. Ingest to restore d6 WIL. You will dream of the dead and their stories. 1 use.                          |
|       |                                                                                                                                                                                |

## What keeps you sane, even in utter darkness? Roll 1d6:

|       |                     |                                                                                                |

| **1** | **Glowsnail**       | Casts a soft, bioluminescent light. Feeds on one ration every two days.                        |
| **2** | **Silk Moth Shawl** | A weatherproof blanket, it can also douse a fire without being damaged.                        |
| **3** | **Milkflower**      | A gentle stimulant. Chewing it makes you immune to _panic_ for the next hour. 3 uses.          |
| **4** | **Luxcompass**      | Hums softly as it moves closer to the Sun. Eventually the noise becomes unbearably loud.       |
