|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **1** | **The Wild Tongue**. A bundle of leather-bound scrolls. A seminal work, cataloging the hidden languages of beasts and how to understand them.                                                            |
| **2** | **The Silent Symphony**. Bound in fluorescent wrap. Very rare, it chronicles the subtle signs used by those employing invisibility magic.                                                                 |
| **3** | **A Treatise on the Abyss**. A nondescript black book. An in-depth, largely theoretical text describing the **Roots**, as well as information about the location of a nearby **Gate**.                  |
| **4** | **The Star Waltz**. A comet-shaped clasp bound in a fine leather cover. Detailed astronomical charts, celestial movements, and stellar festivals. Highly valued (100gp) for its usefulness to travelers. |
| **5** | **The Cathedral and the Canopy**. Large-leaf binding over vellum. Nominally a children's storybook, the margins detail information about traveling, eating, and sleeping in the cloud forests.            |
| **6** | **Garden of Glass**. Bound in the cover of another book. A heretical work, it describes the materials, procedures, and optimal locations required to open a **Gate**.                                     |

| **1** | **Fib Ink**       | Glows when used to write true statements but fades if used to write false ones.                                           |
| **2** | **Cipher Stone**  | A pair of sharp black stones. Each one decrypts any message written by the other.                                         |
| **3** | **Everquill**     | A quill that writes on any surface. You still need ink. _Petty_.                                                          |
| **4** | **Whisper Vial**  | Whisper a message into the vial, and it will play it back to whoever opens it next.                                      |
| **5** | **Sanguine Lens** | Extracts blood from a target without their knowledge. A stolen drop placed on the eye reveals memories from the past day. |
| **6** | **Echo Leaf**     | A blank parchment. Whomever unfurls it sees their actions of the day slowly revealed in a tight scrawl. _Petty_.          |
