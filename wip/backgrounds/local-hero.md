| **1** | A well-crafted dagger (d6, 50gp) with the town's emblem engraved on the hilt. It's more ornamental than practical; you could sell it in a pinch.  |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to...

**The Town Council**. The adventuring party took part in a local celebration, but things got out of hand. The revelry turned into chaos, causing extensive property damage. The Town Council demands that the group either pays for the damages (150gp per PC) or performs a service for the town, such as dealing with a dangerous threat, in order to make amends.
