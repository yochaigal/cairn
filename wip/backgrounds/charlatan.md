## How was your fraud exposed?

|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Your "patients" reported miraculous recoveries, making you famous and forcing you to seek new opportunities. Start with bandages, ointment, and a knack for healing. |
| 2    | After seducing a wealthy individual, their family hired a criminal gang to retrieve you. You escaped but need to lay low for a while. Start with a scroll of _Charm_.|
| 3    | You unconsciouly mimic another's mannerisms, voice, and speech patterns. You do not feel at home in your own skin, and are prone to bouts of shivering, shaking, and _deprivation_ if you go more than a day without practicing your craft. Your condition forces you to travel without end, seeking a cure.|
| 4    | Known as a thrill-seeker and provocateur in **The Cobbles** until your latest stunt destroyed a priceless artifact, and left least at least a dozen injured. Start with a captain's uniform, a ceremonial sword (bulky, 60gp), and a bouquet of flowers. |
| 5    | You have a knack for the sleight of hand, passing it off as the real thing for a spot of gold. Unfortunately you crossed paths with a **Hedgewitch**, who cursed you for taking advantage of the common folk. Whenever you lie, your money (wherever it may be) vanishes. You have no idea where it goes. An odd quirk of this is that you can always tell when someone _else_ is lying, too. Start with an extra 2d20gp and a bad attitude. |
| 6    | You were a self-proclaimed speaker for the dead, selling your services as a bridge from this world to the Great Beyond. In actuality, you possessed a spellbook of _Raise Spirit_, cleverly hidden beneath your seance table. Ineviteably a skeptical patron investigated your workmanship and discovered your secret. Cast out, you fled with what you could. Take the spellbook, a bundle of scarves, and an incomplete knowledge of astrological charts. |

## What identifying keepsake do you carry?

|     |                                    |                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Royal Crest**                    | Born into royalty, you chose a life of crime. The crest grants you access, but also alerts yoru family of your whereabouts. |
| 2   | **Pop's World-Famous Miracle Oil** | A slippery, smelly concoction inherited from a family member. You can't bring yourself to rid of it. It is very, very, slippery. |
| 3   | **Surgeon's Soap**                 | A lye and ash block that makes skin transparent, revealing anatomy. You have three bars.                        |
| 4   | **Goat Powder**                    | Derived from the placenta of a baby goat.  Temporarily cures any affliction, but symptoms return within hours.  |
| 5   | **Cursed Sapphire**                | Returns to your pocket each time you spend it. You can't seem to get rid of it, either. Valued at around 200gp. |
| 6   | **Wooden Sword**                   | A wooden sheath with a fixed pommel, useful as a club (d6) or costume prop. Something jiggles inside.           |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to...

The **Guild of Tricksters, Rapscallions, and Interlopers**. They demand that you either pay 1d4 years in backdated guild fees, or be booted from the organization, your personage besmirched forever. Also, they will take one of your thumbs as recompense. The trouble is, you can't remember actually _joining_ the Guild...
