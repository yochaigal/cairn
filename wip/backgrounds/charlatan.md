## You Get

A fancy hat, a cane, several vials of indeterminant liquid from prior ventures.

## What Drove You Out?

1. **Snakes:** The source of the oil you were intending to sell united and rose up against you.
2. **Betrayal:** Your Mark sold you out to the Mercantile Guilds. Your old partner now lives comfortably while you'll never be able to professionally sell anything again.
3. **Vengeance:** The last town you schemed over petitioned a Law Spirit to to get even with you.
4. **Guilt:** You honestly thought mercury lolipops would have made the children stronger.
5. **Deficiancy:** You've gone through almost every idea in the book, now you adventure for a sense of inspiration.
6. **Runner-Up:** An old rival always beat you to the punch - better pitch, more elaborate show, and they even made some money off of it. You decided you were tired of being second fiddle.

## What Did You Keep From Your Past?

1. **Pizazz:** A small crate of fireworks is left from your smoke and mirrors performances.
2. **A Very Vicious Pug:** You often dressed it up in fake leathery wings and mock horns, then you'd "exorcise" the little imp with ancient chants and hidden sausages.
3. **Rock Oil:** One pint of a grease that only lubricates minerals.
4. **Cassiel's Clever Cure:** A potion that will cure any disease, but unfortunately causes a different, completely random one.
5. **Soap:** A by-product of your usual platform, you have a nearly endless supply of lye.
6. **Invisibility Balm:** One tin of an amazing lotion that will turn one individual invisible. The user's skin becomes completely transparent, but the skeleton and organs remain opaque.
