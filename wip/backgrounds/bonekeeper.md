## What did you take from the dead? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |

| **1** | A **crow-shaped amulet**. With it you can ask one question of the dead (take a **Fatigue**). They do not always speak truly.  |
| **2** | A **mortal wound** from an escaped _revenant_. You were healed, but the disfigurement has made you a pariah amongst the living: you require neither air nor sustenance. You are still subject to pain and death, but the dead see you as their own.                                         |     |
| **3** | A **Blood Pail** (_bulky_) from the lich worshiped by a local death-cult. Empty its contents to summon a creature built from items buried below (bones, rocks, pottery, etc). It obeys your command, but if destroyed you _permanently_ lose 1d4 STR. It has 6 HP, 1 Armor, 13 STR, 11 DEX, 4 WIL, shard fists (d8). **Recharge**: Fill the bucket with the blood of the dying. |     |
| **4** | A **burial wagon** (+6 slots) and a stubborn old **donkey** (+4 slots, +2 slots with wagon). Something really bad happened during your duties. The story changes each time. |     |
| **5** | The [_Frozen Corpse_](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/#frozen-corpse) spellbook from an ancient library. Your family worked in service to an obscure underworld deity, but you lost your faith. Though exiled, you continue to serve even as an apostate.    |     |
| **6** | A **plague doctor's mask**, after its owner succumbed to a disease that wiped out everyone you once knew. They should have kept it on.

## What tool was invaluable in your work? Roll 1d6:

|     |               |                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Manacles**  | Old, but still pretty effective, even against the very strong. You don't have the key.                                            |
| 2   | **Sponge**    | Supposedly made from the remains of a rare sea creature. It never seems to get dry.                             |
| 3   | **Pulley**    | Great for moving gravestones, rocks, or even bodies.                                                                             |
| 4   | **Incense**   | Perfect for rituals, or to keep the flies at bay. Cools the blood.                                                                |
| 5   | **Crowbar**   | Sometimes you just need to get the damn thing open!                                                                               |
| 6   | **Repellent** | Powerful stuff. Its faded label makes it unclear what it is actually _meant_ to repel, though. Perhaps everything. 3 uses. |
