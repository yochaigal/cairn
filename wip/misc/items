### Relics
#### Root of the Earth, 1 Charge

- A gnarled wooden talisman in the shape of a twisted root.
- Spend the charge to instantly tunnel a 5-foot-wide, 50-foot-long tunnel through any solid material (stone, ice, etc.). The tunnel remains until the next dawn or dusk, whichever comes first, then it collapses and is permanently sealed.
- **Recharge**: Plant the talisman in fertile soil and water it with your own blood; it regains its charge after one full moon cycle.

#### Spirit Flask, 3 charges

- An ornate glass flask with silver filigree and a cork stopper.
- Spend a charge to capture the soul of a recently deceased creature (must be used within 1 hour of the creature's death). The soul remains trapped in the flask until released.
- Release a captured soul to do one of the following: ask it 3 questions (it must answer truthfully), gain a brief burst of its knowledge or skills (lasts 1 hour), or force it to possess a willing or unconscious host.
- A soul can only be used once; after being released, it passes on to the afterlife.
- **Recharge**: Allow the flask to soak in the light of a full moon for an entire night.

#### Medusa's Eye

- A round, polished stone that resembles an eye with a serpentine slit pupil.
- When activated, the eye glows with a faint green light, and all creatures within a 30-foot cone in front of you must make a successful WIL save or be turned to stone for 1d4 turns. Creatures that successfully save are immune to the eye's effects for 24 hours.
- After each use, roll a d6. On a 1, the eye crumbles to dust, and its magic is lost forever.

#### The Everquill

- A quill made from the feather of a celestial bird, said to never run out of ink.
- Writing with the Everquill allows the user to create any non-magical document they can imagine, provided they have the necessary knowledge and skill to do so. The quill's ink is waterproof, smudge-proof, and resistant to fading.
- Additionally, any mundane writing or drawing made with the Everquill is of exceptional quality, appearing as if created by a master of the craft.

#### Heart of the Forge, 1 charge

- A fist-sized chunk of molten metal that always remains hot to the touch, but never cools or solidifies.
- Spend the charge to instantly heat any non-magical metal item to a molten state, making it soft and malleable for 1 minute.
- **Recharge**: Expose the Heart of the Forge to the heat of a volcanic eruption.

#### Whispering Windchime

- A set of delicate, crystalline chimes that emit a soft, soothing sound when stirred by the wind.
- When hung outdoors, the chimes attract friendly spirits and fey creatures, who are drawn to their calming music. These beings may provide valuable information or assistance, but may also be capricious or unpredictable in their behavior.
 - The chimes are fragile and can be easily broken if not handled with care.

#### Orb of the Elements, 1 Charges

- Same as _Elemental Wall_, limited to the currently charged element (fire, water, air, or earth).
- **Recharge**: Expose the orb to a powerful source of the chosen element (e.g., a raging fire, a waterfall, hurricane-force winds, or an earthquake).

### Dreamdust, 2 Charges

- Sprinkle the dust over a sleeping creature to enter and manipulate their dreams.
- **Recharge**: Collect dew from the petals of a blooming midnight rose.

### Tempestwhistle, 1 Charge

- Blow the whistle to summon a localized storm lasting 1 hour, with rain, thunder, and lightning.
- **Recharge**: Stand atop a mountain peak during a thunderstorm, allowing lightning to strike the whistle.

###  Umbramantle, 2 Charges

- While wearing the cloak, blend seamlessly into shadows, becoming nearly invisible in darkness.
- **Recharge**: Spend an entire night hidden in the shadows of a graveyard.

### Doppelstaff

- Create an illusory duplicate of yourself, visible only to one creature of your choice.

### Barrierbreaker

- Break through a solid, non-magical barrier up to 5 feet thick with a single punch.

### Skystrider

- Walk on air as if it were solid ground, up to a height of 30 feet.
