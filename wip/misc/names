When creating a fantasy setting using plain English names, consider the following rules:

Keep it simple and descriptive: Use clear, straightforward words that accurately describe the features of the location.
Use familiar terms: Choose words that are easy to understand and can be recognized by a majority of people.
Connect the terrain and location: Make sure the name reflects the landscape and geography of the area.
Consider history and culture: Incorporate any historical or cultural elements of the setting into the name.
Use alliteration and assonance: These techniques can make names more memorable and pleasing to the ear.
Limit the number of words: Aim for two to four words to avoid overly long names.
Combine words creatively: Experiment with combining words in unexpected ways to create unique and evocative names.
Here is a table that connects terrain, descriptions, and common plain English names:

Recap
In this guide, we've provided a step-by-step process for creating a province for your tabletop RPG. The process includes the following:

Determine the province's Scale, Details, Terrain, and Settlements.
Create a map for your province, including its terrain, settlements, lairs, and ruins.
Develop the Heart of your province, with a central settlement and its surrounding details.
Establish a Ruler for your province, determining their role, name, and the history of their rule.
Create Factions that operate within your province, determining their types, names, and locations.
Name your province based on its key geographic features, history, and the factions that have dominated the region.
Remember to consider the interactions between the factions, the landscape, and the province's history as you continue to develop your setting. As you build out additional provinces, think about how they might interact with one another and how their histories might be connected.

Feel free to adjust or add details as needed to make the setting your own. Enjoy your new province and the adventures it will inspire!



## Creating Location Names

- Roll on the table for the appropriate **Domain**.
- Roll a d66 on each table twice, first for the adjective and then for the noun. 
- Combine the results to create a name! You can also mix in a randomly rolled [Name](#on-naming) with the results. 

### Tips & Changes
- Be specific! "Golden Barley" creates a more vivid image than "Golden Fields."
- Use contrasting words (e.g. "Thorny Meadows") to evoke an interesting detail about the location.
- Make it sound nice. Alliteration and pleasing combinations can create pleasant sounds. "Babbling Brook" is more pleasing than "Rambling Brook."
