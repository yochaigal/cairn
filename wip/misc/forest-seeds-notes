| **1**   | A patch of perfectly round toadstools. Blue-white wings flutter between, their wings humming a hypnotic tune. | A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.                   |
| **2**   | A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable. Something shiny glints just beyond.                             | A fairy circle, covered in black moss. Something about it feels off.                                |
| **3**   | A dryad sits atop a stone, a purple fungus lining her arms. There is a violence to her eyes.                  | A great oak has been felled, perhaps by lightning. A large hole is rent on one side.                |
| **4**   | A gnarled tree trunk with an uncannily carved face on its trunk.                                              | A lone Woodwose stands directly on the path ahead, holding a large stick.                           |
| **5**   | A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay. Within, a stone statue of some forgotten deity.         | A robed woman is tending to a wounded animal, whispering in its ear.                                |
| **6**   | A massive boulder blocks the path ahead. It is actually a buried troll, turned to stone by the sun.           | A rotted, vine-covered cabin, clearly abandoned long ago. A delicious smell wafts from the window.  |
| **7**   | A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground. A broken spool of rope lies nearby.                            | A small bearded man argues with a squawking raven. It holds something shiny in its beak.            |
| **8**   | A snarling pack of wolves surround a fresh kill. They are not keen to share.                                  | A tiny hovel is nestled in a tree's roots. The smell of baking bread wafts out.                     |
| **9**   | A spectacular waterfall, spraying rainbows high. A silver horn splits the cascade, its owner obscured.        | A tree, all but consumed by blight. In its boughs, something cries out as if trapped.               |
| **10**  | A trap, hastily set and poorly concealed. It smells strongly of urine.                                        | A trio of satyrs playing and dancing to music. They seem ignorant of any observation.               |
| **11**  | A tree acting as makeshift bridge over a glittering stream. It appears sturdy.                                | A troll sits holding a mirror, engaged in deep conversation with its own reflection.                |
| **12**  | A trio of ravens circle ominously overhead. Suddenly they burst into action, diving down into the bush.       | A windless glade with a large willow at the center. It sways softly, as if to some unseen breeze.   |
| **13**  | A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny. It appears to be a small suit of armor.           | Dozens of smallfolk have setup a market here, trading forest goods. Their wares are impressive.     |
| **14**  | A Woodwife gathers herbs, singing a melancholic song. She disappears into the wood if provoked.               | In the crook of a hollow tree, six ravens squawk and preen. If observed they stare back in silence. |
| **15**  | A wounded animal, whining pitifully and limping. There is intelligence in its eyes.                           | Sleeping peacefully atop two boughs, a giant is snoring. The ground vibrates in response.           |
| **16**  | An old watchtower, hidden by dense forest growth. Something larger looms just around the bend.                | The path ends at a small pond. The water looks pure, but something moves subtly within.             |
| **17**  | Bees swarm protectively around a tree brimming with honeycombs. A cloaked figure silently observes nearby.    | Statues of warriors, their faces lined with horror.                                                 |
| **18**  | Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers.                                       | A maze, invisible save for a faint shimmer.                                                         |
| **19**  | Shadowy figures dart between the trees. Hushed voices call out to one another.                                | Footprints that glow faintly under moonlight, but vanish when touched.                              |
| **20**  | Wild berries grow here in abundance. None have been eaten, not even by birds.                                 | A flower that changes color based on the emotions of those nearby.                                  |
