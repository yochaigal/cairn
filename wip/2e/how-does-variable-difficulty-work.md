# How Does Variable Difficulty Work?

## Introduction

Cairn lacks mechanics such as Attribute modifiers, Advantage and Disadvantage, and so on. This design emphasizes one of the game's core conceits: that play should focus on narrative, in-world experiences over mechanical resolutions. Player characters are encouraged to pursue advantages through critical thinking and problem-solving, not by stacking together external mechanics! As a result, preparing situations for variable difficulty can sometimes feel opaque or even difficult to achieve. The following principles and examples may provide some structure:

## Principles for Variable Difficulty 

- Create situations that emphasize non-mechanical solutions. A problem is more interesting when the key to solving it can be understood purely within the fiction. 
- Reward thinking outside the box. This may be a simple mitigation of risk, a new piece of knowledge, character growth, and more.
- Extend positive outcomes according to effort. If the PCs worked really hard to make something succeed despite the danger, enhance the result to match their trouble.
- Emphasize fictional consequences rather than mechanical buffs. Purely mechanical rewards are usually hollow and lack the potential of in-world benefits.
- Many dangers can be mitigated or extinguished given time, effort, and skill. If there is no real risk, just skip the roll!

## The Environment

> Freya is facing off against a Wood Troll after being separated from the rest of the party. Pinned between the creature and a cave wall, she has no choice but to engage in direct combat. She has already passed her initial DEX save and thus gets to attack before her opponent.

**Freya**: _"I know I can't beat this guy fair and square, so I'd like to know if there is anything nearby that might even the odds a bit. I grew up on the streets, which means I know how to fight dirty. I'd like to try and blind him without getting clobbered in the process. What are my options?"_

**Warden**: _"I'll roll a Die of Fate to see how dusty things are around here. A 4! Alright, there is definitely some dust between you and your opponent, but you might need to get close to him in order to scoop some up. You'll need to make a DEX save."_ 

> Freya rolls a 13: a success!

**Warden**: _"You grab a fistful of dust off the ground in front of you and toss it straight into your opponent's face. He staggers backward and appears unable to defend himself as he fights to clear the grit from his eyes!"_

> The Wood Troll loses a turn as he tries to remove the dust from his face. Until he succeeds, he also has only 0 HP.

**Freya**: _"I know I should run for it... but I can't help but take advantage of this situation. I'd like to introduce this fellow to the Twins."_

> Freya rolls d6+d6 for her daggers, dealing 5 damage directly to the Wood Troll's STR Attribute.

**Warden**: _"You stab him with both blades, green blood gushing from open wounds as the creature roars out in anger. Let's see if it survives the attack! Oooh, it fails its STR save and takes **Critical Damage**! It's down!"_

**Freya**: _"Alright, I'm taking this as a sign. Time to make my exit!"_

> Freya flees the scene (no DEX save required), leaving the Wood Troll to bleed out, or so she thought...

## Stacking the Odds

> Wolfram, Lucius, and Freya are investigating rumors of an invisible creature that has been attacking locals in the Wood. They've tracked the creature to its island den just 40ft from the shoreline of a poison lake. The lake is separated from the surrounding forest by heavy mud flats.

**Warden**: _"The creature's footprints end at the shore of a roiling lake that bubbles and swirls violently. Knowing the history of the region, you realize that if the lake water doesn't kill you, the toxic fumes stemming from its surface definitely will!"_

**Wolfram**: _"We know that the blasted thing makes its home on that pile of rocks out there. Obviously we can't swim across, but I have an idea about how we might draw it out! Lucius, I'm sorry but of the three of us, you're the most... soft. In other words, the perfect bait! Let's make it seem as if your cart is stuck in the mud. I've had a blanket rolled up in my blanket for a while now, perhaps Freya and I can hide under it, then pounce on the creature at just the right moment?"_

**Lucius**: _"I knew I shouldn't have worn my fancy hat today! Fine, let's proceed."_

**Warden**: _"The party executes their plan as described, creating the perfect bait for their unsuspecting quarry. I'm going to roll a Die of Fate to determine whether the creature even takes notice... a 5! Alright, that means that the creature definitely wants to investigate the situation, but there's a wrinkle as well: it's starting to get dark."_

**Freya**: _"Presumably this means that Wolfram and I are able to spy on the island while we hide, right? And that Lucius is still looking the opposite way, pretending to fuss over a stuck wheel?"_

**Warden**: _"Correct. Both Wolfram and Freya can still see through the cart slats that something clambered out from beneath the pile of rocks on the island, scattering them as it moves towards the water. You can't actually tell what moved the rocks, though. It really is invisible! As you watch, something slips into the toxic waters, making a quiet splash. Based on the ripples on the surface, it appears to be heading in your direction!"_

**Wolfram**: _"Well I guess this is as good a time as ever to bring out my Voidglass Shard! It lets me see invisible creatures, but packs a wallop! I won't be able to see out of one eye for an hour, during which time my fighting skills will be... less effective. Might I be able to get a shot with the crossbow while looking through the glass?"_

**Warden**: _"You need two hands for the crossbow."_

**Freya**: _"I can hold the Voidglass Shard up to his eye."_

**Warden**: _"That will work, but you won't have an action of your own until after the creature has a chance to react."_

**Lucius**: _"Um, what about me? I won't be able to see the creature at all, let alone defend myself! I'd like to prepare an action for the moment Wolfram gets a shot off. I still have the large sack from our last caper, I wonder if I could leap on the creature when it approaches, trapping it like a giant fish?"_

**Warden**: _"That works! You each prepare yourselves for what is to come. Freya and Wolfram, you wait in silence and the ripples come ever closer. Finally, they stop! Freya places the Voidglass Shard on Wolfram's eye as he raises his crossbow. Wolfram, you see a slimy, fish-like creature climbing out of the water, yellowed scales crisscrossing its multi-limbed body. There is a brief, breathless pause and then a loud TWANG as he lets loose a crossbow bolt."_

> Wolfram rolls a d8, resulting in a 6! As the creature was unaware of its attackers, the damage goes directly to STR. It makes a Critical Damage save, and the result is a 3: a success. 

**Warden**: _"The creature is impaled by the bolt, green fluid spurting out of its body. Where it lands, the surface hisses as if in contact with acid. It turns towards the cart, but before it can react Lucius throws his large sack over it. The creature thrashes about inside the sack, twisting in every which way."_

> The Warden makes a DEX save for the creature to see if it can quickly break free from the sack. Out of water, it has only 8 DEX. It rolls a 12: a fail. Unable to defend itself, the creature is quickly tied up and placed in the cart, along with a jar of the toxic water for the journey. Working together, the party quickly heads back towards town.

## History + Position

> The party is acting as escorts deep in Thunn Country, far from their usual haunts and safe locales. Just as the Sun gasps its final rays, the long road turns Eastward towards a small village surrounded by tall wooden walls. This is their final destination, and the harder part of their journey. Their job is to sneak their client into the heavily guarded town, and then into the ancient abbey of Der Thunn. Lucius has been sent ahead to investigate, posing as a troubadour from the South.

**Warden**: _"You approach the walled village, following the dirt trail that leads directly into the town's front entry. Two guards stand on either side of the gate, which is closed. The guards are nearly identical save for a weak mustache worn by one."_

**Lucius**: _"Ho there fine gentlemen! May one such as myself inquire as to whether entry to your village would be permissible on this fine evening? I've had a long journey but am flush with gold and would love spread some of my good luck!"_

**Warden**: _"The two men look at each other. The mustachioed guard replies, 'No entry after dark. That's the rule.'"_

> At this point, Lucius is putting on all his charm, and essentially trying to bribe the guards to gain entry. He is also the most at risk in this situation, as the two men are well-equipped to handle a lone traveler, and have backup besides. If it were required Lucius would make the WIL save and not the guards.

**Lucius**: _"Yes, I understand. But it isn't quite dark yet, is it? The Sun is only just setting. May I please enter? I'd happily start sharing my newfound wealth with you two first, if you catch my drift. Perhaps I could bring you each a well-earned beer? To show my appreciation, of course._"

**Warden** _"The two men again exchange a look. This time the other man replies, smirking his words. 'Well... perhaps this once. The Sun hasn't truly set just yet. And we are quite thirsty, after all.'"_

> The Warden made a ruling based on what was known about these men: they were simple village guards, they'd been working a long day, and they loved beer. Perhaps with another character this wouldn't have worked, but Lucius is a Mountebank and his capacity for winning the confidence of his targets has been well established. For him, the risk is minimal. The guards let him in. Later, Lucius is been captured after helping his friends sneak into town. In a sudden glut of courage, he allowed himself be taken so that the others could escape. Now he waits in the jails beneath the constabulary awaiting sentence. 

**Wolfram**: _"Pity about Lucius. But we have to deliver our client to the abbey immediately. We can rescue him after."_

**Freya**: _"I am NOT leaving him behind. You two should go, but I'm going to get him out. I'm a cutpurse, so I have friends everywhere, right? Or perhaps there's some kind of thieves' cant I can use to make connections here?"_

**Warden**: _"Indeed. You can spend the night trying to make connections among your kind, if you like._"

> The party splits up, and Freya learns what she needs to from a local fence. It costs her one of the Twins.

**Warden**: _"In the dim light of the early dawn, you notice a note slipped through the street vent. It reads, 'Speak the following, and you will be free: "The Pale Man Longs To Die." You have but one chance.'"_

**Lucius**: _"...What? OK. Someone gave this to me? And I have to speak it aloud... but at the right time, or to the right person?"_

**Warden**: _"You hear footsteps as the jailer approaches. He jingles his keys as if he intends to open your cell. What do you do?_"

**Lucius**: _"OK! This is not the right person, I think. Perhaps I'll talk to someone higher up?"_

**Warden**: _"He opens your cell and beckons for you to come out."_

**Lucius**: _"Hello friend! Might I speak to your superior? I have some important news that might be very interesting to them..."_

**Warden**: _"The jailer smirks as he unlocks raises a pair of manacles._"

**Lucius**: _""THE PALE MAN LONGS TO DIE!"_

**Warden**: _"The jailer stops in his tracks, then lowers the manacles. He nods once, then gestures that you follow him."_

**Lucius**: _"Well, that was lucky. What is this some code for jailers? Executioners? Well, whatever it is, I'm following."_

**Warden**: _"The jailer guides you into the darkness of the jail, far from the light. As he reaches the far wall, he taps three times on a stone high above his head. After a moment, the wall swings inward, and the guard walks confidently inside, where a dark-haired woman waits at a desk. She smiles at you, and gestures that you sit at the chair across from her."_

**Lucius**: _"Can I go back to my cell, please? Oh... fine. I guess I'll see what she wants."_

**Warden**: _The jailor leaves as you take a seat. The room is small, with only one door on the other side of the woman. A very large man stands outside, his head visible through a small window on the door. The woman smiles again, saying, 'Welcome Mr... Well, it doesn't matter. There is only one reason you are here. You've spoken a code known only to thieves and scoundrels. And which one are you, I wonder?"_

> Lucius is yet again forced to rely on his experience as a confidence man and trickster, but this time the stakes are much higher! He reasons that only the truth will set him free, assuming his captor believes it.

**Lucius**: _"I'll be straight with you: my friends and I are here to sneak into the abbey of Der Thunn. I only learned of that phrase a few minutes ago, I believe one of my friends (a cutpurse named Freya, you might know her) left me that note. If you set me free, I'll be sure to mention... what's your name, again?"_

**Warden**: _"Katja. And please, tell me everything._"

> Lucius describes the party's goal, and their efforts so far. He does not know where his friends are, but assumes they are safe. He is wholly at risk here, and Katja _must_ believe him in order for him to be released. He makes a WIL save. He rolls a 5, a success! Katja is convinced of his sincerity.

**Warden** _"As she listens to your story, Katja frowns, then finally smiles. 'Alright, alright, I believe you. Let's make a deal! You introduce me to this client of yours that you've so kindly escorted into my town, and I'll make sure no one is watching while you slip away. But we have to go right now, before this place implodes on itself. And if that happens, even I can't guarantee your safety..."_ 

> An hour later, Lucius finds Freya, but not the others. She explains that Wolfram and their client have already left for the abbey. She agrees to take them there, but that she needs to make a quick stop first. Something about reclaiming one of her daggers...
