# Changelog

## Playtest packet 6-30-23

### General notes 

- _petty_, _bulky_, _blast_ should all be in italics
- items in background tables should be **bolded**
- **Fatigue** should be bolded.
- **Recharge** should be bolded.
- Spells should be _italicized_
- **Critical Damage** should be bold.
- **Rations** should probably be bolded since they are an item. 
- Phrases like **one step** should probably be bolded or _emphasized_

### Principles (7)

- Remove warden principles

### Character Creation (13)

- Rename Character Creation header/title to Character Creation Summary?
- Update grammar in first bullet
- second bullet, what list is it talking about?
- third bullet, say what page it is happening on
- fifth bullet, emphasize table in note on Omens
- Backgrounds: change instructions for d20, not d66!
- Add header above ability scores (e.g. Character Creation)
- Hit Protection: add more bullets
- Inventory: "four to five items", Emphasize deprived, bold "cannot"
- Item size: why is petty and bulky underlined here?
