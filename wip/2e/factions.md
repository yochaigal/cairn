# Factions Overview
- Rules for initially generating **Factions** for your setting can be found [here](/wip/2e/setting#factions).
- **Factions** possess **Advantages** that allow them to accomplish their goals, the culmination of which will result in fulfilling their **Agendas**.
- All Factions also face **Obstacles**, which prevent them from easily accomplishing their **Agendas**
- A **Faction** may be governed by a one or more powerful figures, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with subordinates known as **Seneschals**.
- **Factions** will work to complete their **Agendas** independently, enlisting the help of PCs only when advantageous.

> The setting map should reflect the impact of **Factions** as they work on completing their **Agendas** and acquiring more **Advantages**.

#### Factions Creation Procedure
- First, follow the initial Factions Creation instructions found in [Setting](/wip/2e/setting#factions), if you have yet to do so.
- Follow steps **1-5** for each **Faction**.
1. Consider how many **Advantages** a **Faction** would have (between 2-4) based on their **Faction Type** and roll accordingly on the [**Faction Advantages**](#Advantages) table. Flesh out the specifics of the Advantages as indicated by the results from the table. 
2. Roll on the [**Faction Agendas**](#Agendas) table and consider what their specific **Agenda** may be given your current information. 
3. Roll on the [**Faction Obstacles**](#Obstacles) table. Use the result to consider what might prevent the **Agenda** from succeeding.
4. Establish a series of 3-4 goals that _must_ be accomplished for this **Agenda** to be accomplished. See [Goals](#goals) below.
5. Create at least one [**Seneschal**](#Seneschals), inspired by the **Faction** type, **Advantages**, and **Agenda**, and **Obstacle** that were generated. Place them at the **Faction's** home base, or at a **Detail** where the interests of the Faction lie.

> Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels "off" or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

## Advantages
- **Advantages** reflect a **Faction's** influence, materials, wealth, and unique features. **Advantages** are best interpreted through the lens of **Faction Type**.
- **Factions** add or lose **Advantages** by trying to complete their **Agenda** (see below).
- **Factions** leverage **Advantages** as much as possible to achieve their goals, and at the same time work to acquire _more_ **Advantages**.

## Agendas
- **Agendas** are accomplished through the completion of **goals** that work toward a clear objective or purpose. They are rooted in desire: that for power, wealth, revenge, resources, etc.
- **Agendas** should not be small things.  Their successful completion should potentially change the landscape of a setting.

> If a Faction completes an **Agenda**, either roll another one or choose the option from the table that is best supported by developments in the fiction.

|         |                |                                                                      |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d12** | **Agenda**     | **Example Agendas**                                                  |
| **1**   | **Collect**    | Bring together ancient artifacts once thought lost.                  |
| **2**   | **Defend**     | Protect a person, place or thing at all costs.                       |
| **3**   | **Destroy**    | Eliminate a rival faction, artifact, or person.                      |
| **4**   | **Domination** | Bring disparate factions under the same leadership, and then expand. |
| **5**   | **Enrich**     | Concentrate as much wealth in the faction's coffers as possible.     |
| **6**   | **Infiltrate** | Place members in other factions, asserting control from within.      |
| **7**   | **Overthrow**  | Replace the current leadership with themselves.                      |
| **8**   | **Preserve**   | Maintain the status quo, whatever the cost. Order isn't cheap.       |
| **9**   | **Purge**      | Rid the land of a custom, belief, or people.                         |
| **10**  | **Revenge**    | Rectify a perceived injustice. Direct experience unnecessary.        |
| **11**  | **Reveal**     | Disclose a long-kept secret, not necessarily for personal gain.      |
| **12**  | **Revive**     | Restore a former leader, god, or locale and pay it tribute.          |

## Obstacles
- All **Agendas** have at least one **Obstacle** that stands in the way of their completion.  
- Additional **Obstacles** can arise through **Faction Actions** (see below) or through developments in the fiction.

|         |                           |                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d12** | **Obstacles**             | **Example Obstacles**                                                           |
| **1**   | **Dog Eat Dog**           | Another **Faction** is vying for the same or similar **Agenda**.                |
| **2**   | **Cloak & Dagger**        | The **Agenda** must be carried out in absolute secrecy.                         |
| **3**   | **Guardian at the Gate**  | A powerful figure or foe must be eliminated to ensure a successful **Agenda**.  |
| **4**   | **Consequnces are Dire**  | The **Agenda** contravenes an established code. Violation pays a heavy penalty. |
| **5**   | **Special Set of Skills** | Accomplishing the **Agenda** requires specialists of an uncommon sort.          |
| **6**   | **Tools for the Job**     | A particular object or Relic is required to complete the **Agenda**.            |
| **7**   | **Perfect Timing**        | The **Agenda** must be carried out at a rare or exact moment.                   |
| **8**   | **Public Perception**     | A significant portion of the population openly opposes the **Agenda**.          |
| **9**   | **Opposition**            | Another **Faction** opposes the **Agenda**, and will attempt to stop it.        |
| **10**  | **Limited Means**         | Considerable capital will be required to carry out the **Agenda**.              |
| **11**  | **Rotten from Within**    | The **Faction** has a been infiltrated by a spy, intent on sabotage.            |
| **12**  | **Body Count**            | Someone must die to ensure a successful outcome. The **Agenda** demands it.     |

### Goals
  - Goals are _progressive_, each building on the previous successes (or failures) of earlier goals.
  - Most goals should focus on acquiring a distinct **Advantage** in order to proceed to the next goal.
  - At least one goal should deal with the **Faction's** primary **Obstacle** (see above). This may be the first goal, or the last.

## Seneschals
- **Seneschals** are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the **Agenda** of a **Faction**.
- Particularly large **Factions** may have additional **Seneschals**, often with each in charge of a different set of **Resources**
- Small **Factions** may have a single leader that acts as **Seneschal**, and may even be a **Faction** of one!

> Often **Seneschals** will have personal motivations that differ from the Faction's main **Agenda**, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

## Faction Rules
- By default, **Factions** operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the **Factions** should still act to achieve their aims.
- Whenever a **Faction** is positioned to advance a **goal** in their **Agenda**, roll a **d12** on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table. 
- If two **Factions** are _opposed_, the **Faction** _most at risk_ makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking **Seneschal**. 
  - On a success, the **Faction** most at risk rolls on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, and their opponent does not.
  - On a fail, the **Faction** most at risk _does not_ roll on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, but their opponent does.

> The **Warden** should rely on the fiction to determine whether a **Faction** is positioned to advance their **Agenda**. **Goals** may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more **Factions**, etc.

### Faction Actions

|           |                   |                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d12**   | **Consequence**   | **Impact**                                                     |
| **1-2**   | **Failure**       | A new **Obstacle** is introduced, and a **Advantage** is lost. |
| **3-4**   | **Setback**       | An **Advantage** is lost.                                       |
| **5-6**   | **Status Quo**    | Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.                        |
| **7-8**   | **Mixed Success** | A **goal** is achieved,  but an **Advantage** is lost.          |
| **9-10**  | **Success**       | A **goal** is achieved, and no **Advantages** are lost.        |
| **11-12** | **Major Success** | A **goal** is achieved, and a new **Advantage** is found.      |

> The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a **Faction** action, or in some cases shift the outcome of the roll in a favorable or unfavorable direction.
