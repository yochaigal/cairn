# Factions

A region is typically dominated by one or more factions, each with their own unique **Advantages**, **Agenda**, and **Obstacles**. Each faction should also have one or more representatives, or **Agents**, tasked with helping complete their agenda. Smaller regions with fewer POIs should have 1-2 factions, while larger regions could have as many as 5-6 factions. 

Agents are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the Agenda of a faction. Particularly large factions may have additional agents, each in charge of a distinct goal. Agents may have personal motivations that differ from the faction's main agenda, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

> Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels "off" or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

## Advantages

Factions possess advantages that assist them in accomplishing their agenda. Advantages reflect a faction's influence, materials, wealth, and other unique features. Factions add or lose advantages by trying to complete their agenda, leveraging their advantages as much as possible to achieve their goals, and at the same time work to acquire _more_ advantages. Larger factions will

## Agendas

Factions will work to complete their agendas independently, enlisting the help of PCs only when that would strengthen their agenda. Agendas are defined by a series of 3-5 goals that build toward a clear objective. Goals are _progressive_, building on the previous successes (or failures) of earlier goals. 

Goals should focus on acquiring a distinct advantage in order to proceed to the next goal. At least one goal should deal with the faction's primary obstacle. This may be the first goal, or the last. All agendas have at least one obstacle that stands in the way of their completion. Additional obstacles can arise through faction Actions (see below) or through developments in the fiction. 

Completing a faction's agendas should be a significant event, potentially changing the political or natural landscape of a region.

> The region map should reflect the impact of factions as they work on completing their agendas and acquiring more advantages.

## Creating factions

Roll 2d20, first for the number of advantages the faction has, then for each subsequent advantage. For example, if a "2" was rolled for the "# of Advantages" column, you would roll on the "Advantage" column twice, noting each result. Reroll repeated results.

## Example Faction

### Type

- **Academics**: _Royal Cartographer's Guild_

### Advantages

- **Apparatus**: A _Map of the Dead_. It opens a path to the underworld, and to the secrets of the dead.  
- **Renown**: None would dare defy the _Guild_ publicly. Their voice carries great weight in the kingdom.
- **Agents**: _Dr. Horatia Confi_, first order. Discovered the _Map of the Dead_. Stats as human (WIL 15).  

### Agenda

The _Guild_ has long been at war with the _Holy Order of Yix_ (figuratively and otherwise) for over a century. It is time their ignorant sect was brought to its knees. _The Order_ is currently favored by the monarchy, but that could all change.
- Hire a skilled party, and lead them to the _Gates of the Underworld_. _Dr. Confi_ will lead the expedition.   
- Travel through the lands of the dead in search of the _Order_'s founder, and force their to reveal an ancient secret.
- Reveal the founder's secrets - including their true identity - to the monarchy. Tie up any loose ends, including witnesses.

### Obstacle

The _Guild_ has received legitimate intelligence that a well-placed operative moves within their ranks, and is aware of the coming operation.

## faction Rules

- By default, factions operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the faction should still act to achieve their aims.
- Whenever a faction is positioned to advance a goal in their agenda, roll a **d12** on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table. 
- If two factions are _opposed_, the faction _most at risk_ makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking agent. 
  - On a success, the faction most at risk rolls on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, and their opponent does not.
  - On a fail, the faction most at risk _does not_ roll on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, but their opponent does.

> The **Warden** should rely on the fiction to determine whether a faction is positioned to advance their agenda. Goals may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more factions, etc.

| **11-12** | **Major Success** | A **goal** is achieved, and a new **Advantage** is found.      |
