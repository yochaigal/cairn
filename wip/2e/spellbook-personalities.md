|         |                       |                                                              |                                                              |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**   | **Adhere**            | An object is covered in extremely sticky slime.              | *Adjacent objects (including Spellbooks) stick to the book with great force, and must be pried off gently.* |
| **2**   | **Anchor**            | A strong wire sprouts from your arms, affixing itself to two points within 50ft on each side. | *Drawing a rope through the iron loop on its spine makes the Spellbook weigh as much as an elephant.* |
| **3**   | **Animate Object**    | An object obeys your commands as best it can.                | *The cover is moldable like clay. Occasional childish laughter sprouts from its pages from time to time.* |
| **4**   | **Anthropomorphize**  | An animal either gains human intelligence or human appearance for one day. | *The book whimpers, purrs and growls depending on its treatment.* |
| **5**   | **Arcane Eye**        | You can see through a magical floating eyeball that flies around at your command. | *Circular; closed with a long string. Can be worn as an eyepatch.* |
| **6**   | **Astral Prison**     | An object is frozen in time and space within an invulnerable crystal shell. | *Crystalline purple binding. Abstract faces stare through a tortoise-shell surface, screaming at the reader noiselessly.* |
| **7**   | **Attract**           | Two objects are strongly magnetically attracted to each other if they come within 10 feet. | *Nearby compasses spin uselessly, and if dropped, the Spellbook always points towards True North.* |
| **8**   | **Auditory Illusion** | You create illusory sounds that seem to come from a direction of your choice. | *Thin and wrapped in a thick, cloth-like paper. The cover does little to muffle random and occasionally comical sounds it produces throughout the day.* |
| **9**   | **Babble**            | A creature must loudly and clearly repeat everything you think. It is otherwise mute. | *While holding the book, the words of others are opaque and difficult to understand.* |
| **10**  | **Bait Flower**       | A plant sprouts from the ground that emanates the smell of decaying flesh. | *The book itself produces no smell at all, not even of paper. Somehow, it still seems to attract any beasts that hunt flesh.* |
| **11**  | **Beast Form**        | You and your possessions transform into a mundane animal.    | *Covered in thick fur, with small teeth lining the edges. The book can be thrown, doing d6 STR damage to its target.* |
| **12**  | **Befuddle**          | A creature of your choice is unable to form new short-term memories for the duration of the spell. | *With each use, the book adds a paragraph to its appendix, describing a loving memory from the target’s past.* |
| **13**  | **Body Swap**         | You switch bodies with a creature you touch. If one body dies, the other dies as well. | *The cover (including any relevant text or images) changes after each use, swapped with another book in this plane.* |
| **14**  | **Charm**             | A creature you can see treats you as a friend.               | *Appears non-descript and mundane to enemies of the current owner. Smells faintly of jasmine.* |
| **15**  | **Command**           | A target obeys a single three-word command that does not cause it harm. | *Long-time keepers of this unadorned black volume will gradually detect mysterious whispers emanating from it, asking them to perform odd tasks with seemingly no purpose. They will find it hard to resist, eventually.* |
| **16**  | **Comprehend**        | You become fluent in all languages for a short while.        | *Wooden pages tied together with strong catgut. Over time, other books exposed to prolonged contact begin to turn blank, as if their words have seeped out.* |
| **17**  | **Cone of Foam**      | Dense foam sprays from your hand, coating the target.        | *The book is spongy and faintly moist to the touch. Leaves behind a soapy residue.* |
| **18**  | **Control Plants**    | Nearby plants and trees obey you and gain the ability to move at a slow pace. | *Large, leafy-green pages glued along the spines. Smells faintly of decay.* |
| **19**  | **Control Weather**   | You may alter the type of weather at will, but you do not otherwise control it. | *Over time, the book changes its cover to suit various weather patterns (protection from heat, wet, snow, etc). Its schedule is unpredictable, as if obeying the weather elsewhere - another place, another land, or perhaps even another world.* |
| **20**  | **Cure Wounds**       | Restore 1d4 STR per day to a creature you can touch.         | *Pure-white thick with bandage-like paper. The last page is perforated and can be torn off to use as a bandage, which re-appears after the Spellbook’s next use. It smells of vinegar and thyme.* |
| **21**  | **Deafen**            | All nearby creatures are deafened.                           | *A soft, velvety book that produces no noise upon touch, not even at the turning of a page. Nearby instruments sound off, as if notes were falling from the air.* |
| **22**  | **Detect Magic**      | You can see or hear nearby magical auras.                    | *The cover is delicate and parchment-like, a sphere is scrawled into its center. The book becomes warm to the touch if a magic is used in the vicinity.* |
| **23**  | **Disassemble**       | Any of your body parts may be detached and reattached at will, without causing pain or damage. You can still control them. | *Even torn to pieces, the book will eventually reform, its pages and cover slowly coming together again.* |
| **24**  | **Disguise**          | You may alter the appearance of one character at will as long as they remain humanoid. Attempts to duplicate other characters will seem uncanny. | *Pressing the book too closely against another will create a mirror image of the other, shifting its size, shape and color to adapt.* |
| **25**  | **Displace**          | An object appears to be up to 15ft from its actual position. | *Never where you last left it. Occasionally bits of string, clothing and leaves are found within its pages.* |
| **26**  | **Earthquake**        | The ground begins shaking violently. Structures may be damaged or collapse. | *The cover is somehow liquid, small ripples emerging from its center. The book is hard to keep open, its spine shifting violently to and from its pages.* |
| **27**  | **Elasticity**        | Your body can stretch up to 10ft.                            | *Solid and immutable, like hardened steel. The pages are extremely heavy.* |
| **28**  | **Elemental Wall**    | A straight wall of ice or fire 50ft long and 10ft high rises from the ground. | *Smells of sulfur. Sometimes the cover leaves a burning residue on exposed skin; other times it is as cold as ice.* |
| **29**  | **Filch**             | A visible item teleports to your hands.                      | *The cover is black and non-descript with no lettering or images. Occasionally a nearby ally’s prized possessions may be found stuck inside the back pages.* |
| **30**  | **Flare**             | A bright ball of energy fires a trail of light into the sky, revealing your location to friend or foe. | *Three wriggly lines are drawn on the cover. The book glows faintly in complete darkness.* |
| **31**  | **Fog Cloud**         | A dense fog spreads out from you.                            | *Made of extremely thin glass that folds open. Can be cast with only one hand, but is very easy to shatter.* |
| **32**  | **Frenzy**            | A nearby creature erupts in a frenzy of violence.            | *Rough, sandpaper cover that destroys any book it touches. Holding without gloves can cause bloody fingers.* |
| **33**  | **Gate**              | A portal to a random plane opens.                            | *A door is cut into the cover, revealing the first page, as well as a series of other pages within. Each successive page opened reveals another part of the spell, requiring a full flip-through to cast.* |
| **34**  | **Gravity Shift**     | You can change the direction of gravity, but only for yourself. | *Objects lighter than the book are slowly pulled towards it. It can be a trifle annoying to pack away with other things.* |
| **35**  | **Greed**             | A creature develops the overwhelming urge to possess a visible item of your choice. | *The cover shifts to show the viewer whatever their heart desires most at the present moment, no matter how well-hidden. Staring at it too long can cause a stupor.* |
| **36**  | **Haste**             | Your movement speed is tripled.                              | *A small raptor is carved into the leather cover. The pages are fluid and difficult to hold on to while reading. Beware papercuts.* |
| **37**  | **Hatred**            | A creature develops a deep hatred of another creature or group and wishes to destroy them. | *A tree is drawn on the front cover, bearing a large fruit in its leafy branches. Long term exposure to the book can cause suspicion, paranoia and distrust amongst even the greatest of friends.* |
| **38**  | **Hear Whispers**     | You can hear faint sounds clearly.                           | *Flipping the book upside down into a “tent” shape and speaking into the crevasse amplifies the voice of even the quietest of speakers.* |
| **39**  | **Hover**             | An object hovers, frictionless, 2ft above the ground. It can hold up to one humanoid. | *A small grey book; it floats if dropped mid-air.*           |
| **40**  | **Hypnotize**         | A creature enters a trance and will truthfully answer one yes or no question you ask it. | *The book cover generates a hypnotic effect, like swirling circles. The reader must be quick or be caught under its spell.* |
| **41**  | **Icy Touch**         | A thick ice layer spreads across a touched surface, up to 10ft in radius. | * Slides across the surface of water as if upon ice, without getting wet.* |
| **42**  | **Identify Owner**    | Letters appear over the object you touch, spelling out the name of the object’s owners, if there are any. | * The 1st page shows the latest user's full name and all aliases, in their handwriting.* |
| **43**  | **Illuminate**        | A floating light moves as you command.                       | * Despite its mundane appearance, the book behaves like a prism, allowing light to pass through and splitting it into a vibrant rainbow.* |
| **44**  | **Invisible Tether**  | Two objects within 10ft of each other cannot be moved more than 10ft apart. | * The thin metal covers of this book have no spine, but behave as if they do. When the covers are pulled apart with force, the pages float evenly between.* |
| **45**  | **Knock**             | A nearby mundane or magical lock unlocks loudly.             | * An old brass lock holding the book shut can only be opened with a randomly selected key from nearby. A new key is chosen each day.* |
| **46**  | **Leap**              | You jump up to 10ft high, once.                              | * This battered tome will fall quickly to the ground at terminal velocity if ever dropped. When used, the caster is guaranteed to have a nightmare about falling the next time they sleep.* |
| **47**  | **Liquid Air**        | The air around you becomes swimmable .                       | * Looking at the ornate cover will make one feel as if they cannot breathe, only relieved by drinking water.* |

| **49**  | **Manse**             | A sturdy, furnished cottage appears for hours You can permit and forbid entry to it at will. | * Bound in plush, homely carpet, the tome vanishes upon use, appearing somewhere within the conjured cottage. If left inside when the cottage disappears, it cannot be recovered.* |
| **50**  | **Marble Craze**      | Your pockets are full of marbles, and will refill every 30 seconds. | * Despite the contents only being paper, this book will make a playful rattling sound when shaken, much like a pouch of many marbles.* |
| **51**  | **Masquerade**        | A characters appearance and voice becomes identical to those of a character you touch. | * The book cover is a simple mirror. When looked into, one will see a more beautiful version of themself, appearing to speak to them. Though the viewer cannot hear, they feel they are being mocked for their inadequacies.* |
| **52**  | **Miniaturize**       | A creature you touch is shrunk down to the size of a mouse.  | * The text of this book is so small a magnifying glass is required for reading. When opened, the holder is hit with heavy pangs of vertigo.* |

| **56**  | **Night Sphere**      | A 50ft wide sphere of darkness displaying the night sky appears before you. | * The navy cover shows the most prominent constellation currently in the sky. The user, however, becomes unable to see any stars for a week, save those in the Night Sphere.* |
| **57**  | **Objectify**         | You become any inanimate object between the size of a grand piano and an apple. | * Those who possess this book will begin to see faces on objects more and more often. At times, they appear to be screaming.* |

| **82**  | **Spider Climb**      | You can climb surfaces like a spider.                        | * The cover is a perfectly symmetrical web rendered in ageing copper.
