# Forest Seeds

## Creating a Forest

Follow this procedure for any forested terrain in a region. 

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Overview

1. Define the forest's inhabitants.
2. Create forest zones and add landmarks.
3. Create points.
4. Create the trails.
5. Create forest encounters.
6. Name the forest.

## Forest Denizens

In some ways the Wood a single entity, its brain alive within every tree and plant, connected via a network of thorn and branch. The animals and plants are its limbs, directing the wants, desires, fears, and needs. The creatures that live within its boundaries are its blood, answering its call by delivering much needed defenses and rebuffing interlopers. The Wood will always protect itself, and its children. Roll on the Traits table, writing the results in your notebook. This describes the general attitude of the creatures found in the forest.

## Create the Map

### Forest Topography

A forest can be broken up into zones, each defined by an obvious **Type** and **Landmark**. The type indicates how outsiders perceive the Wood, and landmarks help travelers navigate through the dense foliage, acting as geographic reference points: unusually tall trees, towers, and so on. Most forest landmarks are visible only by climbing a tree, though a few are large enough to stand out from the green. Some landmarks are _heard_ rather than seen.

- Roll **1d6** on the table, then roll an amount of dice equal to that number on the map. Ignore any dice that roll off the page.
- Draw long, curvy lines across the page, carving up the map around each die. These represent areas where the forest shifts and changes.
- Roll on the [Forest Types](#forest-types) table for each result, noting the forest type on the map. 
  - Replace the die with a triangle and write the landmark result on the map.

| **19**  | Silent    | Stump Cathedral    |
| **20**  | Sunlit    | Volcanic Plume     |

### Create POIs

- Roll **8-12 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the Points of Interest (POI) in the forest.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Forest Die Drop Table](#forest-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Shelter**, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- Select two opposite points, preferably close to the page border. These are the forest's entrance and exit.
- Starting with the entrance and ending at the exit, number each POI on the map.

#### Forest Die Drop Table

|         |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| **d6**  | **POI** |
| **1**   | Monster |
| **2-3** | Ruins   |
| **4**   | Shelter |
| **5-6** | Hazard  |

### Draw Trails

- Starting with the entrance, create 1-4 trails between each point. 
 - Create loops, branching trails, dead-ends, and shortcuts between points.
 - Some trails are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
 - Some trails are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Create intersections (crossed lines) with no rooms in between.
- Roll on the [Trail Types](#trail-types) table for each trail, recording the results in your notebook.

| **19**  | Treeline Heights   | Swaying Plants     |
| **20**  | War Route          | Tree Carvings      |

> If some of the results seem incongruous, that's OK! Create questions from the juxtaposition, such as "Why _is_ there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

### Stock the POIs

- Roll on the relevant tables for each point, writing the results in your notebook. 
- For each point, filter the table results through the theme you generated earlier in this process. 

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature that live in the forest. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not "waiting around" for characters to stumble upon them, but have their own wants and goals. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

#### Ruins

Forests are wild places, but that does not mean people haven't tried to tame them. The remnants of these attempts still show up from time to time, hinting at the folly of those who would stand against the Wood.

#### Shelter

Despite it wild & unpredictable nature, there have always been those that brave, skilled, or foolhardy enough to try and build a life in the Wood. And some do succeed, leaving their mark via smoldering campfire or gray tower, offering a welcome respite to weary travelers.

#### Hazard

The Wood is a dangerous place, and not to be trifled with. The forest and its inhabitants do what they must to survive, and even sated are still preparing for their next meal. Even the trees, plants, and even the earth itself will leave deadly traps and dangers to root out those unworthy to pass beneath the boughs.

## Forestcrawls

A forestcrawl is a simple method for exploring a large forested area, typically made up of branching trails connecting scattered points of interest. While a forestcrawl has some of the same properties as a traditional dungeon delve, it swaps stone walls and ceilings for the dense, non-linear design of a heavily wooded area. Instead of rooms, points of interest are defined as clearings or major changes in the forested landscape. And unlike exploring a dungeon, characters can take shortcuts by going "off-trail" or climb trees to get a better look ahead (with a cost, of course).   

### Exploring The Wood

- Treat the forest as a _Dungeon_. Follow the standard dungeon exploration procedures, rolling on the Dungeon Events table.
- Points in a forestcrawl are close to each other. When traveling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 POIs) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
- If the party attempts to reach a point by going "off-trail" (bushwhacking), the **Warden** should make any associated costs clear: typically time, effort (**Fatigue**), or any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
- If the party is interrupted, stops to investigate something, rest, etc. while exploring a forested zone, there may not be enough time to fully explore each connected point. In these cases, rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much time is left in the day.
