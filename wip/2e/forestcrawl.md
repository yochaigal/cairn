# Forestcrawl

## Introduction
- A forestcrawl is a type of **pointcrawl** (see below) that focuses specifically on travel through forested zones, trying to capture the density, non-linearity, and intricate network of paths within a heavily wooded area. 
- A forested zone is made up of trails connecting various **Details**, or points of interest within a forested zone. 
- For an example map, jump to the [bottom](#example-forest).

> A pointcrawl is a great method for exploring complex, non-linear areas like forests, swamps, or cities, where the paths between points of interest can be labyrinthine and less easily defined than in a wide open space. 

## Exploring The Wood
- **Details** in a forestcrawl are close to each other. Assume that the PCs are taking the [**Explore**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#explore) action, no matter how many locations they visit. 
- When travelling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 **Details**) can be explored in its entirety in a single [**Watch**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#watches). 
- If the party attempts to reach a **Detail** by going "off-trail" (bushwhacking), the **Warden** should make any associated costs clear: typically time, effort (**Fatigue**), or any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the [Wilderness Events](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#wilderness-events) table.

> If the party is interrupted, stops to investigate something, rest, etc while exploring a forested zone, there may not be enough time to fully explore every connected **Detail**. In these cases, rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much time is left in the day. 

## Create The Forest

1. On a flat sheet of paper, draw a dot to signify the forest's **Heart**.
2. Draw a single curving line stemming out from the **Heart**. This is the **trunk**. 
3. Draw three **branches** sprouting off from the **trunk**. 
4. Draw one or two short **twigs** from each **branch**. They can vary in length.
5. Place a dot at the terminus of every **branch**, **trunk**, or **twig**. 
6. Number each dot, starting with the **Heart**. 

> If you'd like to increase the number of **Details** on the map, you can either add more **branches** and **twigs**, or place a dot at the intersection of lines, e.g. where the **trunk** meets a **branch**.

### Populating The Forest

1. Follow the instructions found in the [Details](#details) section.
2. Roll on the [Trail Markers](#trail-markers) table for the **trunk**, as well as each **branch**. **Twigs** use same trails as their respective **branches**.  Label each trail!
3. Roll on the [Spoor Types](#spoor-types) table for every trail. Note the **spoor** for each.
4. Roll on the [Forest Encounters](#forest-encounters) table fore each [Detail](#detail), recording and expanding on the results. 

## Details

- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**.  
- The **Heart** of a forest can be any **Detail**. It is here that the forest is its most powerful, most sentient, and most dangerous. 
- Each **Detail** is connected to its nearest neighbor by a trail, indicated by a specififc [Trail Type](#trail-types). 

### Adding Details

1. Roll on the [Special](#special) table for the **Heart** **Detail**.
2. Generate features for each remaining **Detail** by first rolling on the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any **Settlements** rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.   

> If some of the results below seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn it into a question, like "Why _is_ there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

## Naming Details

1. Roll a d100 on the [Location Names](#location-names) table twice, first for the adjective and then for the noun. 
2. Combine the results with the terrain type to create a location name. 

### Tips & Changes
- Change it up! The name _Welcoming Grove_ creates a more vivid image than _Beckoning Copse_ might.
- Use contrasting words (e.g. _Twisted Canopy_) to evoke an interesting detail about the location.
- Make it sound nice. Alliteration and pleasing combinations can create pleasant sounds. _Whispering Woods_ is more pleasing to the ear than _Tangled Woods._

| **1**   | An enormous deer, its antlers shimmering silver.                               |
| **2**   | The remnants of an old watchtower hidden dense forest growth.                  |
| **3**   | A snarling pack of wolves surrounding a fresh kill.                            |
| **4**   | Suddenly, the usual sounds of nature eerily absent.                            |
| **5**   | A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny.                    |
| **6**   | A circle of perfect mushrooms. Blue-white wings flutter between.               |
| **7**   | A gnarled tree trunk bearing an uncannily carved face on its trunk.            |
| **8**   | Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers.        |
| **9**   | A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay.                          |
| **10**  | A trap, hastily set and poorly concealed.                                      |
| **11**  | A tree acting as makeshift bridge over a glittering stream.                    |
| **12**  | Bees swarm protectively around a tree brimming with honeycombs.                |
| **13**  | Wild berries grow in abundance, a feast for foragers.                          |
| **14**  | Shadowy figures dart between the trees. Hushed voices call out to one another. |
| **15**  | A wounded animal, whining pitifully as it limps.                               |
| **16**  | A spectacular waterfall, rainbows dancing in its spray.                        |
| **17**  | A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable.                                  |
| **18**  | A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground.                                 |
| **19**  | A bird circles ominously overhead. It seems to be following the party.         |
| **20**  | The sky is suddenly darkened by a large object streaking above.                |

## Example Forest

### Draw Trails

- We start by creating the structure of our forest, drawing the first dot representing the **Heart** in the center, Southern part of the region.
- We then draw the **trunk**, creating a gentle curve towards the Northwest.
- Then we draw three **branches** extending from the **trunk**, one towards the East (closer to the **Heart**) and the other towards the West and further North. 
- Finally we draw a single **twig** off of each **branch**.

### Number Dots

- First we place dots at every terminal point. 
- We then assign numbers, starting with the **Heart** at 11. In total, we have 7 dots for **Details**: 
- `1` is our **Heart**.
- `2` is at the beginning (or end) of the **trunk**. 
- `4`, `5`, and `6`, are each at the end of a **branch**.
- `3` and `7` are each at the end of **twigs**, to the East and West of the **trunk** respectively. 

### Assign Trail Markers

For the **trunk** as well as each **branch** and **twig**, we'll roll on the **Trail Markers** table (**d12**):

  - For the **trunk** we got a **6** (_Old Logging Road_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **3** (_Fae Passage_).
  - For the Western **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **4** (_Bandit's Run_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** farthest from the **Heart** we got a **5** (_Pilgrim's Footpath_).
  
### Assign Details

Next we'll roll on the provided tables to generate features for each **Detail**.
- First up is the **Heart (1)**, and we roll on the [Special](#special) table (**d20**). We got an **11** (_Elf Queen's Pavilion_).

For each remaining **Detail**, we first roll on the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table:
- **Detail (2)**: We roll a **d6**: a **4** (Hazard). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Hazards](#hazards) table: a **6** (_Thorny Thickets_).
- **Detail (3)**: We roll a **d6**: a **5** (Landmark). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Landmarks](#landmarks) table: an **11** (_Cathedral of Trees_).
- **Detail (4)**: We roll a **d6**: **1** (Settlement). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Settlement](#settlements) table: a **9** (_Monastic Retreat_). We also roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table with a **d20**: a **20** (Renowned for its scholars).
- **Detail (5)**: We roll a **d6**: **2** (Ruins). Roll a **d12** on the [Ruins](#ruins) table: a **4** (_Crumbled Crypt_).
- **Detail (6)**: We roll a **d6**: **3** (Lair). Roll a **d12** on the [Lairs](#lairs) table: an **8** (_Goblin Hideaway_).
- **Detail (7)**: We roll a **d6**: **6** (Special). Roll a **d20** on the Special table: a **5** (_Will-o'-Wisps_).

### Detail Naming

Finally, we'll name each **Detail** using the [Location Names](#location-names) table. I took some liberties here, smashing together words I liked with random words.

1. **Heart (Elf Queen's Pavilion)**: _Glintleaf Dell_
2. **(Thorny Thickets)**: _Thistlefield_
3. **(Cathedral of Trees)**: _Timbertop Spire_
4. **(Monastic Retreat)**: _Cloister of the Quiet Wood_
5. **(Crumbled Crypt)**: _Shattered Barrow_
6. **(Goblin Hideaway)**: _Mossbreak Nook_
7. **(Will-o'-Wisps)**: _Glimmerglade_

### Example Map

And that's it! Here is the final map. I've added a backdrop from the wonderful [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) to give it more flavor.
