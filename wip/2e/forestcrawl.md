# Forestcrawl

## Introduction
- A pointcrawl is a great method for exploring complex, non-linear areas like forests, swamps, or cities, where the paths between points of interest can be labyrinthine and less easily defined than in a wide open space. 
- A forestcrawl is a type of pointcrawl that focuses specifically on travel through forested zones, trying to capture the density, non-linearity, and intricate network of paths within a heavily wooded area. 
- A forested zone is made up of trails connecting various **Details**, or points of interest within a forested zone. For an example map, jump to the [bottom](#example-map).

## Exploring The Wood
- When travelling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (no more than 15 **Details**) can be explored in its entirety in a single [**Watch**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#watches). 
- **Details** in a forestcrawl are close to each other. Assume that the PCs are taking the [**Explore**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#explore) action, no matter how many locations they visit. 
- If the party attempts to reach a **Detail** without a clearly marked trail or path, the **Warden** should make any associated costs clear: time (a full **Watch**), effort (**Fatigue**), or obvious dangers.

> If the party is interrupted, stops to investigate something, rest, etc while exploring a forested zone, there may not be enough time to fully explore every connected **Detail**. In these cases, rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much time is left in the day. 

## Create The Forest

1. On a flat sheet of paper, draw a dot to signify the **Heart**.
2. Draw a single curving line stemming out from the **Heart**. This is the **Trunk**. 
3. Draw three **Branches** sprouting off from the **Trunk**. 
4. Draw one or two short **Twigs** from each **Branch**. They can vary in length.
5. Place a dot wherever lines intersect, e.g. when a **Branch** meets the **Trunk** or a **Twig** _and_ at the terminus of every line.
6. Number each dot, starting with the **Heart**. 

## Details

- Each dot on the map is one **Detail**. 
- The **Heart** of a forest can be any **Detail**. It is here that the forest is its most powerful, most sentient, and most dangerous. 
- Each **Detail** is connected to its nearest neighbor by a trail, indicated by a specififc [Trail Type](#trail-types). 

### Adding Details

1. Roll on the [Special](#special) table for the **Heart** **Detail**.
2. Generate features for each remaining **Detail** by first rolling on the [Detail Types](#detail-types) table, then on the associated table.
3. For any **Settlements** rolled, roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table as well.   

> If some of the results below seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn it into a question, like "Why is there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!


### Adding Trail Types

1. Roll on the [Trail Marker](#trail-marker) table for the **Trunk**, along with every **Branch**. **Twigs** use same trails as their respective **Branches**. 
2. Travelling on a trail is always fairly quick, but not necessarily safe! 
3. Some trails may simply connect to other forested zones: entirely new regions to explore!

## Naming Details

1. Roll a d66 on each table twice, first for the adjective and then for the noun. 
2. Combine the results with the terrain type to create a location name. 

### Tips & Changes
- Change it up! The name "Welcoming Grove" creates a more vivid image than "Beckoning Copse" might.
- Use contrasting words (e.g. "Twisted Canopy") to evoke an interesting detail about the location.
- Make it sound nice. Alliteration and pleasing combinations can create pleasant sounds. "Whispering Woods" is more pleasing to the ear than "Tangled Woods."
