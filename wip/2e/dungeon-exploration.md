## The Basics

- The dungeon exploration cycle (see below) is divided into a series of **turns**, **actions**, and their consequences. 
- On their **turn**, a character can move a distance equal to their torchlight's perimeter (about 40ft), and perform one **action**. Players can use their **action** to move up to three times that distance, though that will increase the chance of triggering a roll on the [**Dungeon Events**](#dungeon-events) table.
- The **Warden** should present obvious information about an area and its dangers freely and at no cost. Moving quickly or without caution may increase the chance of encountering a wandering monster, springing a trap, or triggering a roll on the [**Dungeon Events**](#dungeon-events) table.

> Although the term "dungeon" is used here, it can be exchanged for any dangerous locale (mansions, farmhouses, adventure site, etc).

## Dungeon Exploration Cycle

1. The **Warden** describes the party's surroundings and any immediate dangers (combat, traps, surprises, etc.). The players then declare their character's intended movements and **actions**. 
2. The Warden resolves the **actions** of each character simultaneously, along with any **actions** that are already in progress. Remember, the Die of Fate can be a useful tool whenever the Warden is in doubt!
3. The players record any loss of resources and any new conditions (i.e. item use, _deprivation_, etc). The cycle then _begins again_. If appropriate, the **Warden** should roll on the [**Dungeon Events**](#dungeon-events) table. Keep common sense in mind when interpreting the results! 

## Dungeon Events

Exploring a dungeon is always dangerous, and time must always be weighed against the risk of awakening the location's denizens, natural hazards, and worse.  
When the party:

- Spends more than one dungeon cycle in a single room or location 
- Moves quickly or haphazardly through a room
- Moves into a new area, level, or zone
- Creates a loud disturbance 

**Roll on the table below.**

|       |                 |                                                                                                           |
| :---: | :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **1** |  **Encounter**  |    Roll on an encounter table. Possibly **hostile** (see [Reactions](/wip/2e/core-rules/#reactions)).     |
| **2** |    **Sign**     |                  A “spoor” (clue, track, scent, victim, droppings, etc.) is discovered.                   |
| **3** | **Environment** |      Surroundings shift or escalate. Water rises, ceilings collapse, a ritual nears completion, etc.      |
| **4** |    **Loss**     | Torches are blown out, an ongoing spell fizzles, etc. The party must resolve the effect before moving on. |
| **5** | **Exhaustion**  |   The party must rest (triggering another roll on this table), add a **Fatigue**, or consume a ration.    |
| **6** |    **Quiet**    |                          The party is left alone (and safe) for the time being.                           |

## Actions

- **Actions** are any non-passive activities such as _searching for traps_, _forcing open a door_, _listening for danger_, _disarming a trap_, _engaging an enemy in combat_, _casting a spell_, _dodging a trap_, _running away_, _resting_, etc. 
- Some **actions** have special rules (see below), while others may take multiple **turns** to complete. 
- Loud or noticeable **actions** may also trigger an **encounter** of the dungeon's denizens. 

### Searching

- A character can spend a **turn** performing an _exhaustive_ search of **one** object or location in an area, revealing any relevant hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, etc. 
- Larger rooms and difficult or complex dungeon terrain may take a few **turns** to properly search.
- Searching a room _first_ is a safer way to explore the dungeon, but it has a steep cost: time.

### Resting

- A character can spend a turn **resting** to restore all **HP**.
- A light source and a _safe location_ are required to **rest**. Present or oncoming danger make **rest** impossible.
- **Resting** does not restore **Fatigue**, as it is impossible to safely **Make Camp** in a dungeon.

## Panic

- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience _panic_. A **WIL** **save** is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming _panicked_. 
- A _panicked_ character must make a **WIL** **save** to overcome their condition as an **action** on their **turn**.
- A _panicked_ character has 0 **HP**, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are _impaired_.  

## Dungeon Elements

### Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft of dungeon, and beyond that only a dim outline of objects. Torches last until they are put out by a character or their environment.
- A torch can be lit 3 times before permanently degrading. A lantern can be relit 6 times per oil can, but requires more inventory slots.
- Characters without a light source may suffer from _panic_ until their situation is remedied. 

### Doors

- Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, moving or blocked entirely. Characters can try to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue), or through raw ability. 
- The party's marching order determines who is most impacted by whatever lies beyond a door.
- A character can detect, through careful observation (listening, smelling, etc.), signs of life and other hazards through nearby doors and walls.

### Traps 

- A cautious character should be presented with any and all information that would allow them the opportunity to _avoid_ springing a trap. An unwitting character will trigger a trap according to the fiction, or otherwise have a 2-in-6 chance.
- **Traps** can usually be detected by carefully **searching** a room.
- Damage from traps is taken from Attributes (usually **STR** or **DEX**) and _not_ from **HP**. Armor can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g. a shield would not reduce damage from noxious gas).
