# Dungeon Exploration

## The Basics
The goal of these rules is twofold: to keep the sense of danger ever-present, and to maintain a consistent sense of time and resources used. Although the term "dungeon" is used here, it can be exchanged for any enclosed space (mansions, farmhouses, etc).

- A dungeon **turn** lasts approximately 10 minutes.
- Each character in the party can perform one **action** during a **turn**. 
- Actions are extended activities like searching for traps or treasure,  forcing open a stuck door, listening for danger or information, disarming traps, etc.
- Some activities take longer than one **turn**, if the room is very large, or the task especially difficult. 
- In general, PCs may be required to take **Fatigue** or spend a **resource** in order to complete a task quickly, or safely.
- A dungeon room is typically **small**, **medium** or **large**. 

## Exploration Sequence
1. The **Warden** describes the room.
2. The Players declare their intended actions (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms).
3. The **Warden** resolves the actions.
4. The **Warden** rolls on the [[**Encounter Table**]](#encounter-table).
5. Repeat 1-4 until a PC departs the room.

## Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ of dungeon, but beyond provide only a dim outlines of objects.
- A torch lasts about 6 **turns** (or one hour) before it burns out. Lanterns and other light sources may differ.

## Searching
- Obvious information about a room should always be offered freely and at no cost, regardless of the room's size.
- A character can spend a **turn** performing a an _exhaustive search_ that reveals any hidden treasure, traps, doors, or information they could possibly uncover.
