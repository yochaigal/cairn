# How Does Variable Difficulty Work?

## Introduction

Cairn lacks mechanics such as Attribute modifiers, Advantage and Disadvantage, and so on. This design emphasizes one of the game's core conceits: that play should focus on narrative, in-world experiences over mechanical resolutions. Player characters are encouraged to pursue advantages through critical thinking and problem solving, not by stacking together external mechanics! As a result, preparing situations for variable difficulty can sometimes feel opaque or even difficult to achieve. The following principles and examples may provide some structure:

## Principles for Variable Difficulty 

- Be transparent with players. This doesn't mean revealing all of the world's secrets, but provide each player with the maximum information their character might have.
- Avoid requiring a dice roll whenever possible. If a PC can solve a problem using purely narrative components, _do not ask for a roll_.
- Create situations that emphasize non-mechanical solution. A problem is more interesting when key to solving it can be understood purely within the fiction. 
- Reward thinking outside the box. This may be a simple mitigation of risk, a new piece of knowledge, character Growth, and more.
- Replace multiple dice rolls with a single dice throw. Simplifying results to a single roll can increase tension while maximizing player input. 
- Extend positive outcomes according to effort. If the PCs worked really hard to make something succeed despite the danger, enhance the result to match their trouble.
- Fictional consequences should triumph over purely mechanical effects. Results that exist purely within the rules are usually hollow, and lack the potential of any in-world impact.
- The outcome of a Save need not be a simple binary. You can tailor the results based on the totality of input: the effort, forethought, resources, and skill that went into the roll.
- Feel free to say "no," but remember to offer an alternative. If the party cannot proceed due to circumstances beyond their control, give them another option to consider.
- Death should always be a choice. If the risk is so great that the outcome might be fatal, make sure the player understands what they're getting into.
- In order for agency to exist, there _must_ be multiple viable options that the PCs can choose from. The more choices, the more interesting the situation becomes.
- Many dangers can be mitigated or extinguished given time, effort, and skill. If there is no real risk, just skip the roll! 

## Pressing the Advantage

> Freya is facing off against a Wood Troll after being separated from the rest of the party. Pinned between the creature and a cave wall, she has no choice but to engage in direct combat. She has already passed her initial DEX save and thus gets to attack before her opponent.

**Freya**: _"I know I can't beat this guy fair and square, so I'd like to know if there is anything nearby that might even the odds a bit. I grew up on the streets, which means I know how to fight dirty. I'd like to try and blind him without getting clobbered in the process. What are my options?"_

**Warden**: _"I'll roll a Die of Fate to see how dusty things are around here. A 4! Alright, there is definitely some dust between you and your opponent, but you might need to get close to him in order to scoop some up. You'll need to make a DEX save._"

> Freya rolls a 13: a success!

**Warden**: _"You grab a fistful of dust off the ground in front of you and toss it straight into your opponent's face. He staggers backwards, and appears unable to defend himself as he fights to clear the grit from his eyes!."_

> The Wood Troll loses a turn as he tries to remove the dust from his face. Until he succeeds he also has only 0 HP.

**Freya**: _"I know I should run for it... but I can't help but take advantage of this situation. I'd like to introduce this fellow to the Twins._"

> Freya rolls d6+d6 for her daggers, dealing 5 damage directly to the Wood Troll's STR Attribute.

**Warden**: _"You stab him with both blades, green blood gushing from open wounds as the creature roars out in anger. Let's see if it survives the attack! Oooh, it fails its STR save and takes **Critical Damage**! It's down!."_

**Freya**: _"Alright, I'm taking this as a sign. Time to make my exit!"_

> Freya flees the scene (no DEX save required), leaving the Wood Troll to bleed out, or so she thought...
