# Growth

## Introduction

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring new places. Instead, it is a character's unique experience in the game world that has the potential to alter their health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, and even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, sometimes in undesirable ways! Keep in mind however that with some notable exceptions (such as _Scars_,) growth should always stem from a character's experiences in the game world. 

## Principles for Growth

- Growth is never arbitrary, but tied to a specific experience happening in the fiction.
- It is more important for a character to become more interesting than to become more skilled or capable.
- Characters experience growth not simply because they've gained a new experience but because that experience has effected them a significant way.
- Place opportunities for growth in as many places as possible.
- Characters grow as often during a play session as they do during Downtime.
- Growth should foster further interaction with the game world and its challenges.
- Growth is not a reward, but the logical result of a character's actions.
- Growth happens most often when a character interacts with something they do not understand, or something they were not _meant_ to understand.
- Characters may change in a way that they don't like, or may gain new abilities at a cost.
- Relics, treasure, factions, monsters, and important NPCs are all excellent potential triggers for growth.
- Characters can change slowly over time or by amassing significant, cumulative experiences around a single type of growth. 

## Triggers: a Framework for Growth

As characters engage with the game world, they must increasingly adapt to new realities in the fiction. Some of these adaptations are minor and rarely revisited again. Others are cumulative, representing a collection of related experiences. And some experiences are so powerful that their impact is immediate and unparalleled. For each of these it can be helpful to assign _Triggers_, or opportunities for growth. These represent significant turning points in a character's life, and should be met with a permanent and related change! The following examples represent an inexhaustive list of triggers that could lead to character growth: 

- Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
- Long-term exposure or manipulation of a powerful Relic 
- Advancement within a Faction
- Resolution of a Bond or Omen
- Forging a relationship with a being of great power
- Interacting with something (or someone) they do not understand
- Overcoming a long-time woe or misdeed
- Success despite a limited talent or ability
- Failure despite a natural talent or ability
- Research or specialized training (typically during Downtime)
- Long-term exposure to a Spellbook or Relic 

Triggers are typically associated with:

- A consistent pattern of behavior
- A clear risk
- A unique resource

### Examples

#### Example 1: Hazel

Throughout her adventures, Hazel made frequent use of  _Control Plants_ Spellbook she'd "borrowed" from the abbey where she grew up. Often she would attempt to enhance its power, making WIL saves each time to expand its reach. Of course, not every attempt was successful, and occasionally she paid a heavy price. On one occasion she and her companions were exploring a jungle temple and stumbled upon a horrific creature made entirely of plant matter. Seeing an opportunity to use the creature's strengths against it, Hazel's allies gathered around her while as read from the Spellbook. The Warden then asked for a WIL save, as she was trying to cast the spell quickly and under duress. A success! The Warden declared that going forward, she would be able to read from her Spellbook while under duress or time pressure _without_ first making a successful WIL save. 

#### Hazel Commentary

Here the Warden had taken into consideration the following:
- Hazel had previously made multiple attempts to bend the Spellbook to her will with mixed results and survived. _This demonstrated a consistent pattern of behavior._
- Hazel took a _major risk_ when she tried to cast the spell quickly.
- Spellbooks are _unique items_ of great power and tremendous risk. 


#### Example 2: Oxrable

_After weeks of searching, Oxrable had finally cornered and defeated the serial murderer Tibor Heimshern. But instead of killing him, Ox used the Soul Extractor to pull the prone man's consciousness straight out of his body. Then to the surprise of everyone at the table, Ox proceeded to **drink the man's spirit.** The Warden called for a WIL save to overcome Tibor's powerful essence: a success! The Warden then asked the player to reroll Ox's Willpower attribute, saying he could keep the results if they were higher. And they were! However, the Warden also ruled that if at any point Ox had another enemy weak and at his mercy, a WIL save would be required to overcome the murderer's dormant tendencies within his psyche._

#### Oxrable Commentary



#### Example 3: Aster

_Aster and his comrades came upon a shrine deep hidden in a forest cave. After some research and experimentation (spearheaded by Aster), they were able to free the nearly-mad river god trapped within. As thanks, the deity offered its unknowable essence to anyone willing to receive it. Aster stepped forward and was **bound to the god**, forgoing his old life and adopting a new religion. A few days later, gills sprouted from Aster's neck after an impromptu dive in a raging river._

#### Aster Commentary



## Downtime & Growth

Downtime procedures are a great way for PCs to focus on training, specialization, research, or faction relationships.


### Old Stuff

Madrigal (a Fungal Forager) has finally found the source of a nearby village's bellowing sickness: a Liverbracket infestation at the bottom of the town's well. After uprooting the fungi, he decided to keep a sample for his future endeavors. He then embarked on a ten-day journey across the Randana Lava Flats in search of a potential Gate to the Roots he'd read about while researching methods to remove this unique fungal growth. The existence of this sample had slipped his mind until many weeks later when he noticed a strange discoloration on his canteen. He was then forced to cut the canteen open, discovering that not only had the fungus spread into his water supply but that he'd been drinking the tainted water for some days. Strangely he'd been unaffected by the strange visions and less-comfortable side-effects common to ingesting the fungus, likely because the effects were being counteracted by his daily intake of Clustermelon Flower, a potent form of heat resistance needed to cross the Lava Flats. He spent a Watch rebuilding his canteen, then set out again.

Three weeks later, Madrigal noticed series of small bumps on his skin, along with a familiar discoloration.
