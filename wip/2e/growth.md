# Growth

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their successes, or when they fail. Nor do PCs gain experience from killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring a new area. Instead, their experiences in th egame world can alter a PC's health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, or even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, and sometimes in undesirable ways! The only hardfast rule is that character growth always stems _from_ the game world. 

## Overview

There are many potential triggers for growth. The following is an inexhaustive list: 

- Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
- Exposure to a powerful Relic
- Advancement within a Faction
- Resolution of a Bond or Omen
- Changed a relationship with a being of great power
- Interacted with something dangerous, and felt its punishment
- Overcame a long-time woe
- Succeeded or failed despite a natural talent or ability
