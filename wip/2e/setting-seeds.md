# Setting Seeds

## Overview

1. Create the region's topography, people, resources, and heart.
2. Extend via paths and new POIs.
3. Terminate via borders.

## Create the Overarching Theme

 - Create the region's terrain and topographic features.
 - Create the civilization's defining aspects, as well as their ambitions.
 - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce?
 - What makes up the heart of this region, and what problems to they have?

### The Heart

The **Heart** is always a **Refuge** of some kind, a place of relative calm and safety. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history. Roll 2d20 and combine the results.

## The Map

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into three categories:  
- **Refuge**: A town, temple, or place of shelter.
- **Landmarks** or **Hazard**: A significant geographic signpost or hazard.
- **Lairs** or **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous adventure site.

The paths that connect POIs them can be divided into four types:  
- _Accessible Paths_ are known by the PCs _and_ accessible. They always appear on in-world maps.
- _Elevated Paths_ are known by the PCs _and_ accessible, but crossing them comes at a higher cost. Climbing them may provide characters with the ability to see more of the world than what appears on an in-world map.
- _Blocked Paths_ are known by the PCs but _not_ directly accessible. They may require special knowledge to bypass, or tools. They will appear on in-world maps.
- _Hidden Paths_ are only known by some, and learning about them always require some kind of _cost_. They do not appear on in-world maps, though there may be hints or clues for those who know how to find them.

### The Basics

- On a flat sheet of paper draw a circle. This is the Heart of your adventure site. 
- Roll 4d12 and write the results around the circle as if it were a clock face. Do not reroll duplicates.  
- Starting with the lowest number, draw any combination of the following Paths:
  - A bold line indicating an _accessible_ path.
  - A dashed line indicating a _hidden_ path.
  - A crossed line indicating a _blocked_ path.
  - A line with a star on top indicating an _elevated_ path.
- At the terminus of each line, add a Point of Interest (POI):
  - A circle to represent a _refuge_ (a town, city, farm, etc).
  - A triangle to represent a _landmark or hazard_ (a rock formation, stone bridge, sinkhole, etc.).
  - A diamond to represent a _dungeon or lair_ (a cave, burrow, crypt, etc.).
- From each POI add a new Path, terminating in a new POI _or_ connecting to an existing POI.
- Number each POI, starting with the Heart.

> At this time, don't focus too much on the specific traits of any Path or POI, as those will be decided later. That includes distance, path types (i.e. trails, roads, rivers, etc.) and refuge details.

### Paths
 
 - Starting from the Heart, select a path and roll 2d4 on the [Path Types](#path-types) table, or choose an appropriate option.
  - Mark the type and distance for each path on your map. For example, if the result is a medium-length road, write "M - Road"
  - Continue this process until all of the Paths on the map have been created.

#### Path Types

|        |            |            |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| **d4** | **Length** | **Type**   |
| **1**  | Short      | Trail      |
| **2**  | Medium     | Road       |
| **3**  | Long       | River      |
| **4**  | Special    | Wilderness |

#### Hidden Paths

| **d20** | **** | **** |
| **1**   |      |      |

| **4**   |      |      |
| **5**   |      |      |
| **6**   |      |      |

#### Blocked Paths

#### Elevated Paths

|              |           |                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Notation** | **Type**  | **Terrain**                                                       |
| **1**        | Montane   | Plateau **(E)**, Valley **(E)**, hills **(T)**, mountains **(P)** |
| **2**        | Subalpine | Forest **(T)**, thickets **(T)**, jungle **(P)**, hollows **(T)** |
| **3**        | Alpine    | Caverns **(P)** canyons **(E)**, cliffs **(T)**, tundra **(T)**   |


**Montane**: Starts where the forest line ends and extends up to the tree line, and is mostly forests and meadows.
**Subalpine**: Just below the alpine zone, characterized by harsher conditions than the montane and often features shrubland, meadows, and sparse forests.
**Alpine**: Above the tree line, this zone includes areas where trees cannot grow, featuring mostly grasslands, rocky terrain, and snowfields.

### POIs, Expanded

Starting with the POI nearest to the Heart, roll on the table appropriate to its type for each:

- A vast tundra of glaciers, ice caves, and beasts long forgotten. Small settlements dot the frozen landscape, competing for food, warmth, and mates. A newly-appointed clan chief is uniting formerly warring tribes, building an army greater than any seen before. Now, their forces are digging into the Star Ridge mountains, searching the icy rivers for something - or someone -long-thought lost to time.
- Within a manufactured dome of alien technology, people live in relative harmony, united by the Benefactor, an immortal entity of powerful knowledge and perception. Crime is nearly obselete, as the Benefactor arrests its perpetrators before even their own intentions are known to themselves. There are those who say this system is unfair, organizing in secret to overthrow their perfect leader. Or so they think...

Now their former enemies comb the lands of this once glorious nation, searching its bloated corpse for whatever riches may remain, all the while wondering who will be next?
- An archipelago boasting thousands of small islands, their biomes equally as diverse as their animals and plant life. Rival factions ride the crimson seas in search of a holy artifact that is prophesized to unite not only the broken clans, but the earth itself. 
- A post-apocalyptic wasteland littered with ancient technology, derelict sky-ships, and ruled by the Time Wizards. Cracked deserts and spiral forests encroach the last megacity, the only true respite from their cruelty.
