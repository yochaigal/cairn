# Setting Seeds

## Overview

The following procedure is designed to help create the _seed_ of a setting: the geography, people, and paths that an adventuring party may have to navigate as they travel throughout a region. We'll start by drawing a map of the region, noting its unique topography, natural features, towns, lairs, dungeons, roads, and so on. Then we'll develop the people of the region, their ambitions and resources, and the factions that rule them.

### Draw the Map

### Materials Required
- At least one sheet of paper. Letter/A4 is OK, but the larger the better.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

- Draw the letter **H** anywhere on a sheet of paper, or roll a d6 and mark where it lands. This is the region's **Heart**, or primary settlement. 
  - Roll 6d6 on the page, ignoring any dice that roll off the page. These are the maps's **Points of Interest** (POI).
  - Note the face up results according to the [Die Drop Table](#die-drop-table), writing its corresponding letter on the page beneath (e.g. R = Waypoint, D = Dungeon, etc.).
- Draw circles around the dice in clumps of 2-4 dice each. These represent the map's regions.
  - The Heart can be in its own circle, or can be included in another region.
  - Regions should be big enough to share a border.
- Roll on the [Regions](#regions) table for each clump, and write the results on on the page.
- For the Heart, roll on the [Settlements](#settlments) table and note the result on the map.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each POI (including the Heart) and note the results.

> Regions are wide swaths of land defined by either a particular terrain (e.g. tundra, hills, etc.), arbitrary political boundaries (a kingdom, a barony, etc.), or both.

### Points of Interest

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Settlements**: Permanent, largely self-sufficient population centers, typically governed by a political body or faction.
- **Waypoints**: A safe place to refill supplies, get a good night's sleep, or get directions. Often rely on travellers for survival, but provide necessary services.
- **Curiosities**: A wilderness locale of note, somewhere remarkable or strange. It may indeed be hazardous, but only if the PCs interact with it.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.

> The **Heart** is always a **Settlement** of some kind. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history

## Create Paths
- Create 1-4 paths between each location.
- Mark the distance between each POI by rolling 1d6 for close POIs, 2d6 for moderate distances, and 3d6 for POIs far apart. The result is how many days of travel between each point.

### Types of Paths

- **Standard**: A path typical to the region, lacking in special features.
- **Barrier**: A geographic obstruction that slows down or completely blocks further travel. Examples can include rivers, changes in elevation, thickly-grown trees, sinkholes, and more. 
- **Chain**: The path is a segment in a series, typically tied to terrain (mountain passes, rivers, trade routes, etc.).
- **Dead End**: Leads to a remote or isolated location.
- **Encounter**: The risk of peril is increased. Roll on the Wilderness Event table an extra time, and the chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Hidden**: A path not appearing on any known maps. Learning about them always require some kind of cost. Additionally, chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Shortcut**: A path that provides a significant boost in speed to another POI.

#### Draw Paths

- On a flat sheet of paper draw a five-pointed star. This is the "Heart" of your adventure site. 
- Select a point on the star, and roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) table and draw the results.
  - Assume that all paths are one Watch long. If you'd like to make them longer, make sure to place more POIs along the way! 
  - Don't focus too much on the specific traits of any Path or POI, at this time. That includes distance, path types (i.e. trails, roads, rivers, etc.) and other details (towns, Ruins, etc.).
  - Create between 3-5 paths from each of the star's points.
- Next, determine whether the path is going to be a Trail (T), a Road (R), or a Wilderness (W) route.

> Some paths may lead to POIs that allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.

## People

- Roll on the [Culture](#culture) table, and record the results:
- Roll on the [Resources](#resources) table and record the results.
- Answer the following:
 - How do the people that live there perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
 - What effects does the region's terrain have on the people that live there? 
 - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce? 
 - How do these factors relate to the other aspects of the region, and how does it shape the people that live there?
 - What would draw someone there, and why would they stay?

## Conclusion

Once you've gathered the results of these tables, combine them in order to create a cohesive theme for this region. For example, if I rolled a region covered in plains and surrounded by rivers, I might assume that the locals here were tradespeople, selling their wares to the neighbors downriver. If I rolled that the people there were religious and sought conversion, I'd assume they were a proud folk, but prone to religious extremes and proselytizing. And if their primary resources were land, I'd assume they grew their own food, but that their traders were always on the search for spices from distant lands.
