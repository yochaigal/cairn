# Setting Seeds

## Overview

The following procedure is designed to help create the _seed_ of a setting: the geography, people, and paths that an adventuring party may have to navigate as they travel throughout a region. We'll start by drawing a map of the region, noting its unique topography, natural features, towns, lairs, dungeons, roads, and so on. Then we'll develop the people of the region, their ambitions and resources, and the factions that rule them.

## Example

[![Alt text](/img/2e/setting-seed-example.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="40%" width="40%"}](/img/2e/setting-seed-example.png)

## Materials Required
- At least one sheet of paper. Letter/A4 is OK, but the larger the better.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

## Draw the Map

- Draw the letter **H** anywhere on a sheet of paper, or roll a d6 and mark where it lands. This is the region's **Heart**, or primary settlement. 
  - Roll 6d6 on the page, ignoring any dice that roll off the page. These are the maps's **Points of Interest** (POI).
  - Note the face up results according to the [Die Drop Table](#die-drop-table), writing its corresponding letter on the page beneath (e.g. W = Waypoint, D = Dungeon, etc.).
- Draw adjacent circles around the POIs (including the Heart) in clumps of 2-4 each, large enough to share a border with one another. These represent the map's regions.
- Roll on the [Regions](#regions) table for each clump, and write the results on on the page.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each POI (including the Heart) and note the results.
- Number each POI, starting with the Heart.

> - The **Heart** is always a **Settlement** of some kind. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history
> - Regions are swaths of land defined by either a particular terrain (e.g. tundra, hills, etc.), arbitrary political boundaries (a kingdom, a barony, etc.), or both.

### Points of Interest

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Settlements**: Permanent, largely self-sufficient population centers, typically governed by a political body or faction.
- **Waypoints**: A safe place to refill supplies, get a good night's sleep, or get directions. Often rely on travelers for survival, but provide necessary services.
- **Curiosities**: A wilderness locale of note, somewhere remarkable or strange. It may indeed be hazardous, but only if the PCs interact with it.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.

> Some POIs may allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.

## Paths & Landmarks

**Paths** act as geographic connectors on the map, ranging from well-traveled roads to rough wilderness routes. Paths should provide compelling choices between POIs, who must weigh factors such as safety, speed, and travel difficulty. 

### Path Types

- **Standard** paths are obvious or well-trod routes between two POIs, represented by a thick line.
- **Hidden** paths do not appear on any known maps. Their discovery always requires some kind of cost. Represented by a dashed line.
- **Conditional** paths may be blocked, or requires specialized tools (boats, climbing gear, etc.) to cross. Others may even be impossible to navigate without a map or guide. Represented by a crossed line.
- **Landmarks** are unique, visible POIs that can also be used as geographic reference points: towers, mountains, tall buildings, and so on. They help orient travelers around the map, and can help to identify terrain, regions, settlements, and curiosities from afar. Landmarks are _especially_ visible from areas with higher elevation or a clear viewpoint. Each path should have at least one visible landmark, represented by a triangle drawn somewhere along the path.

### Draw Paths & Add Landmarks

- On your map, create 1-4 paths between each location.
  - Add at least two Hidden Paths, represented by a dashed line.
  - Add at least two Conditional Paths, represented by a crossed line.
  - Create loops, branching paths, dead-ends, and shortcuts between POIs.
  - Some paths may be parts of a chain and tied to a particular terrain (mountain passes, rivers, etc.).
- Decide whether each path represents a road, a trail, or a wilderness route and add them to the map. 
  - Roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) tables for every road or trail, and note the results. 
  - Each path should have a visible Landmark somewhere along the way, represented by a triangle somewhere along the path. Landmarks do not need to be numbered.
- Determine the path distances and note the time on the page:
  - POIs a short distance apart take one Watch to traverse, a medium distance apart take two Watches, and a long distance apart take three Watches. 
  - For Trails add 1 more Watch, and for Wilderness routes add 2 additional Watches.
  - A Watch is 8 hours long. Denote days between POIs wherever possible (typically two Watches and one rest per day).

## People

The most important aspect of a setting are its _people_. But they are shaped by the terrain and history of their region, which is why we generate their character, ambitions, and resources at the very end. 

- Roll on the [Culture](#culture) and [Resources](#resources) tables for every region that has a settlement. and record the results. Then answer the following:
  - How do the people that live there perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
  - What effects does the region's terrain have on the people that live there? 
  - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce? 
  - What would draw someone there, and why would they stay?

## Conclusion

Once you've gathered the results of these tables, combine them in order to create a cohesive theme for this region. For example, if I rolled a region covered in plains and surrounded by rivers, I might assume that the locals here were tradespeople, selling their wares to the neighbors downriver. If I rolled that the people there were religious and sought conversion, I'd assume they were a proud folk, but prone to religious extremes and proselytizing. And if their primary resources were land, I'd assume they grew their own food, but that their traders were always on the search for spices from distant lands.

> - Everything beyond this point is just for reference; we'll have a separate naming chapter I think. Still, might be helpful.
> - You can follow the [Factions](/wip/2e/factions.md) rules for generating Factions to populate your map, and the [Dungeons] or [Forestcrawl](/wip/2e/forestcrawl.md) rules to build each of your POIs. 

## On Names 

- Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Rotting Gardens_, etc.
- Important places (like cities) should have important names, like those of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events: _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.
- Wild and dangerous places are named after their obvious hazards: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: _Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path_, etc. 

### Generating Names

- Starting with the **Heart**, roll on the [Names Formula](#names-formula) table to name each POI on the map.
- Use both the region's dominant terrain as well as the specific POI details where appropriate. 
- Roll on the [Adjectives](#adjectives) and [Nouns](#nouns) table, and consult the [Terrain Synonyms](#terrain-synonyms) table for inspiration. 
- Refer to the [Example Names](#example-names) for a model of each table result. 
- [**Proper Nouns**] can be added to or even replace parts of a name, e.g. **Bruna's Ugly Gulch**. 

| To roll **1d100**, roll **2d10**, using one die for the tens place, and one die for the ones place.
