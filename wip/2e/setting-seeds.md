# Setting Seeds

## Overview

The following procedure is designed to help create the _seed_ of a setting: the unique topography, natural features, people, and paths that an adventuring party may have to navigate as they travel throughout a region. We'll start by develop the people that live their, their ambitions and resources, and the factions that rule them. Then we'll draw a map of the realm, noting its points of interest, landmarks, roads, trails, and so on.

## The Realm

A **Realm** is a general term for the combination of terrain, political boundaries, and people that live in a particular place. This term can also refer to the overall "theme" of your setting, as well as the sorts of adventures the player characters will get up to. Realms are defined by the culture of the people that live there, their ambitions, their resources, and the Factions that rule them.

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is OK, but the larger the better.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.

## Theme

### People

The most important aspect of a realm are its _people_: their character, ambitions, and the resources that tie them to this land. Roll on the [Culture](#culture) and [Resources](#resources) tables, then answer the following:
- How do the people that live here perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
- How does the Realm's dominant terrain effect the people that live here? 
- What would draw people here? What would keep them here?

Note the results in your notebook.

### Factions

A Realm is dominated by one or more Factions, each with its own unique advantages, goals, and obstacles. Roll 1-4 times on [Faction Types](#faction-types), [Faction Agendas](#faction-agendas) and [Seneschals](#seneschals) tables, then answer the following for each Faction:
- What power do they have over the people who live here?
- Who or what threatens their Agenda?
- How would the Faction interact with any newcomers (i.e. an adventuring party)?
- What sorts of people act on behalf of these Factions?

Note the results in your notebook.

## Put it all Together

You should now have a sufficient idea about the people of this realm, including their character, ambitions, resources, and Faction details, and are finally ready to form these results into a coherent theme. 

For example, if I rolled up a realm covered in plains and surrounded by rivers, I might assume that the locals here were tradespeople, selling their wares to the neighbors downriver. If their land was prone to dust storms, I may decide that the people are hardy, and probably wear clothing appropriate to a dust bowl setting.

If I rolled that the people there were religious and sought conversion, I'd assume they were a proud folk, but prone to religious extremes and proselytizing. And if their primary resources were land, yet spices were rare, I'd assume they grew their own food, but that due to a religious prohibition their cuisine was often bland.

Presume that I also rolled up a ruling Faction of Nomads, whose primary Advantage was their conviction, I would assume the elites were a class of religious chiefs. If the Faction's Agenda was to cultivate a rare resource, but that they were hindered by cultural taboos, I might decide that they had hired the party to take on the task. Perhaps the object of their quest was a unique plant, only grown in a distant place, and that the mission must remain a secret? 
 
Finally, the party would meet with one of the Faction's Seneschals, a spy posing as a Peddler. Only he could tell them where the plant grew, and how to cultivate it.

## Draw the Map

### Points of Interest

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Settlements**: Permanent, largely self-sufficient population centers, typically governed by a political body or faction. The **Heart** (see below) is always a settlement of some kind.
- **Waypoints**: A safe place to refill supplies, get a good night's sleep, or get directions. Often rely on travelers for survival, but provide necessary services.
- **Curiosities**: A wilderness locale of note, somewhere remarkable or strange. It may indeed be hazardous, but only if the PCs interact with it.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.

#### The Heart

The focal point of a realm is called the **Heart**, or primary settlement. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the realm, but it should always be significant to the realm's history and people.

#### Create POIs

- Draw the letter **H** anywhere on the map, or roll a d6 and mark where it lands. 
- Roll 6d6 on the map, collecting any dice that roll off the page and setting them aside. These are the maps's Points of Interest.
- Remove each die, noting the face up result according to the [Die Drop Table](#die-drop-table) on the page. For example, the number 4 would indicate a Lair, denoted by the letter "L" on the page. 
- Roll any dice that fell off the map page, repeating the previous process until no dice are remaining.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each POI, including the Heart. Note the results for each in your notebook.
- Number each POI, both on the map and in your notebook.

> Some POIs may allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.

#### Landmarks

**Landmarks** are unique, visible POIs that can also be used as geographic reference points: towers, mountains, tall buildings, and so on. They help orient travelers around the map, and are _especially_ visible from areas with higher elevation or a clear viewpoint.

- To create Landmarks, roll 3d6 dice on the map, ignoring the face-up result, writing the result as a triangle.
- Number each Landmark on the map, then roll on the [Landmark Features](#landmark-features) table, noting the results in your notebook.

### Topography

- Draw wide curves around clumps of 2-4 POIs, dividing the map into at least two "bands" of terrain. 
- Roll on the [Terrain](#terrain) table below for each band, noting the results in the map.

> As with any other table, if you don't like the result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Paths

**Paths** act as geographic connectors on the map, ranging from well-traveled roads to rough wilderness routes. Paths should provide compelling choices between POIs, who must weigh factors such as safety, speed, and travel difficulty. 

#### Path Types

- **Standard** paths are obvious or well-trod routes between two POIs. _Represented by a thick line._
- **Hidden** paths do not appear on any known maps. Their discovery always requires some kind of cost. _Represented by a dashed line._
- **Conditional** paths may be blocked, or requires specialized tools (boats, climbing gear, etc.) to cross. Others may even be impossible to navigate without a map or guide. _Represented by a crossed line._

#### Draw Paths

- Starting with the Heart, create 1-4 paths between each location. 
  - Create loops, branching paths, dead-ends, and shortcuts between POIs.
  - Some paths may be parts of a chain and tied to a particular terrain (mountain passes, rivers, etc.).
  - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
  - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Designate each path using the number of a POI and its connecting point, e.g. 1 &harr; 3. You can denote this in your notebook under the originating POI or in a separate section.  
- Decide whether a path represents a road, a trail, or a wilderness route and write the results in your notebook.
- Roll on the [Path Features](#path-features) table for each path, writing the results in your notebook. 
- Determine the path distances between POIs and note the duration on the map:
  - A short distance between POIs takes one Watch to traverse, a medium distance takes two Watches, and a long distance takes three Watches. 
  - For Trails add 1 more Watch, and for Wilderness routes add 2 additional Watches.
  - A Watch is 8 hours long. Denote days between POIs wherever possible (typically two Watches and one rest per day of travel).

## Conclusion

Your realm is now complete...

[ add concluding words ]

> - Everything beyond this point is just for reference; we'll have a separate naming chapter I think. Still, might be helpful.
> - You can follow the [Factions](/wip/2e/factions.md) rules for generating Factions to populate your map, and the [Dungeons] or [Forestcrawl](/wip/2e/forestcrawl.md) rules to build each of your POIs. 

## On Names 

- Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: _Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Rotting Gardens_, etc.
- Important places (like cities) should have important names, like those of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events: _The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine_, etc.
- Wild and dangerous places are named after their obvious hazards: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: _Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path_, etc. 

### Generating Names

- Starting with the **Heart**, roll on the [Names Formula](#names-formula) table to name each POI on the map.
- Use both the realm's dominant terrain as well as the specific POI details where appropriate. 
- Roll on the [Adjectives](#adjectives) and [Nouns](#nouns) table, and consult the [Terrain Synonyms](#terrain-synonyms) table for inspiration. 
- Refer to the [Example Names](#example-names) for a model of each table result. 
- [**Proper Nouns**] can be added to or even replace parts of a name, e.g. **Bruna's Ugly Gulch**. 

| To roll **1d100**, roll **2d10**, using one die for the tens place, and one die for the ones place.
