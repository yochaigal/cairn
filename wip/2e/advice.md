## Wilderness Exploration

You might have something like this, a journey between two POIs, with Easy terrain and on a Trail:
- ** Travel Distance**: 2 Watches in good weather.
- **Weather**: Raining. 
- Watch one: Travel on a trail across a grassy plain. _The party did not get lost._
 - [Events Table]: **Sign**. One of the party members looks around after traversing a small hillock, and spies something glittering in the distance behind them. It disappears after a few seconds. Could that be a spyglass, reflecting in the sun?
- Watch two: Travel continues on the same trail and plain. _The party did not get lost._
 - [Events Table]: **Environment**. The weather has worsened in the evening, and as a result the plain is muddy and the trail harder to follow.  The party is forced to slow their march considerably, only reaching the the edge of the grasses at nightfall. They are forced to find shelter in the open plain rather than at their destination in the adjacent forest.
- Watch three: Make Camp. The party sets up a hastily-made shelter and each member consumes a ration. A lookout rotation is set (there are four party members), and the other three go to sleep. 
 - [Events Table]: **Sign**. The sky clears up enough for the first guard to see a light in the distance, flickering slowly. A campfire! Someone is definitely following them.

## Dungeon Exploration

## Combat

**Example 1**
Say you have a fighter-type facing off against a bugbear near a riverside cave. In one scenario, she is unprepared, and flails her weapon wildly at the bugbear, using her existing skills and combat training to deal d6 damage with her sword against the bugbear. Combat proceeds as normal, until someone is defeated.

**Example 2**
Now imagine the same fighter, but instead of directly attacking she looks at her surroundings. The player asks, "Is there anything here that would allow me to somehow blind the bugbear, or at least reduce its attack potential? Perhaps some sand?" The Warden rolls on a d6 (Die of Fate) and gets a 4 - this is good news. He tells her that the although ground is pretty flat here, her PC would have noted the pile of dirt not far away from where she is currently standing, just near the river, downhill a bit. She'd need to book it before the bugbear catches up to her (DEX save to leave combat), but on a success she'd have more than enough time to prepare for her attack. 

The player reminds the Warden that her character has an acrobatic background, specifically the circus (this was established long ago as part of her backstory). She argues that her character would likely have some advantage leaping down hills, tumbling, and son on. The Warden agrees that this would be the case, and the PC makes a run for the dirt clod, attempting to leave the bugbear far behind

---
**Example 2a**
The PC makes a DEX save: a fail! "You make a good start of things, but lose your footing about halfway down. You tumble uncomfortably down the hill, taking 1 STR damage in the process. You land face-first in the dirt, but due to your acrobatic nature you are able to glom on to some heaps of muddy earth, just as you hear the creature approach from behind." The bugbear makes a DEX save to avoid, and fails: attacks against it are now enhanced, and its attacks are impaired!

---
**Example 2b**
The PC makes a DEX save: a success! They easily arrive at the base of the hill, with plenty of time to pocket some dirt. So much so that they are able to throw dirt at the creature, and it is unable to save: it is just a bugbear after all - proper planning makes the attempt a piece of cake. The impact is the same as in **2a** but in addition the PC can go first - it has the jump on the creature. Or I might rule that the PC can just deal direct damage in this case.

I've written these examples up to try and illustrate a few things:
- players thinking outside the box
- using your surroundings/fictional positioning, not mechanics to succeed
- using background elements to get "permission" for things to happen, or to modify the consequences (imagine what would have happened had she not been a circus performer?)
- Pressing opportunities through clear advantages
- adjudicating using the die of fate (_is_ there dirt down there?)

This is not to say that GM Fiat isn't a factor. It is - all games of this style are merely GM Fiat. The difference is the procedure for play and how you incorporate elements of the fiction in a clear and consistent way.
If the Warden had rolled a 1 on the Die of Fate, the answer would simply have been NO. And the PC would need to find another option.
