# Character Creation

- Unless otherwise noted, every PC starts with a torch (3 uses), rations (3 uses), and 3d6 gold pieces.
- First roll on the [Backgrounds](#backgrounds) table below. A PC’s background informs their potential knowledge and skills. You'll need to refer to the Background result for the next few steps.
- Choose a name from the available list, then roll on each of the included tables in the background. Record your character's items, skills, or abilities gained (or lost) from each result. See [Inventory](#inventory) for how to record items.
- Roll for your character's **Ability Scores** and **Hit Protection**.
- Roll for the rest of your [**character's traits**](#character-traits-d10) and their **age** (2d20+10).
- Finally, roll on the [Bonds](#bonds) table.      

> Note: If you are the _youngest_ character, roll on the [Omens](#omens) table. The result should be read aloud to the rest of the table.

## Backgrounds

- Some backgrounds may ask you to roll on the [Gear Tables](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/equipment#gear-tables).
- To roll on the table below, roll a **d6** twice, first for the **tens** place, and then another for the **ones** place. 
- The backgrounds below are clickable!

## Ability Scores  

- Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**.
- Roll 3d6 for each of your character's ability scores, in order. You may then swap any two of the results.
- Ability scores are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily weak; they can still attempt to raise a door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher. 

## Hit Protection  

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [**Scars**](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd#scars-1) table.

| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d20** | **Bond**                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **1**   | You inherited a single gem (cold and brittle, one slot) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: spend your riches (worth 500gp) and a debt long thought forgotten would be called.                 |
| **2**   | A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take **20gp**, and an **ornate compass** that always points towards something deep in **The Woods**.                                                              |
| **3**   | You carry a hand-drawn **portrait** of a past love who disappeared into **The Woods** long ago. Somehow, you know that they are still alive.                                                                     |
| **4**   | You trespassed on the **Wooded Dead's** sacred grove. To atone you must retrieve a corpsewood sapling. They grow in places populated only by the dead.                                                           |
| **5**   | You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some **silver moss**. Swallow it near water and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.                                             |
| **6**   | You inherited an old **journal**, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly from the journal's perspective. The writing is crude, but accurate.                      |
| **7**   | You protect a long-dormant family secret. Take one half of an **ancient key**. They say that if joined with its twin, it opens a **Gate** through any door.                                                      |
| **8**   | You received a letter detailing incontrovertible proof that your true parontage is that of Fae nobility. The note also indicated a date and location where you are to meet them, deep in the **Woods**.          |
| **9**   | You owe a great debt to a figure of some nobility, and carry their **signet ring**, which serves as proof both of their protection as well as your obligation.                                                   |
| **10**  | You consumed a mischievous spirit that now periodically wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home. It wants to keep you alive, albeit uncomfortably. You still carry the **bottle** it came from. |
| **11**  | A former mentor is dying of a rare disease. The healing herbs they require are found only in **The Woods**, but are dangerous to acquire. Take a **waterproof pouch**.                                           |
| **12**  | During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a **letter**, sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the **Lord of Winter**.                     |
| **13**  | Someone close to you traded a family heirloom to a shadowy entity from **The Cobbles**. Take a **sketch of the artifact**.                                                                                       |
| **14**  | You promised a childhood friend that you'd bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a **bracelet** woven from twine and wildflowers.                                                 |
| **15**  | You crossed a creature of **The Wood**, and it cursed you with a **stone heart** (bulky). With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die.         |
| **16**  | You carved a **whistle** from an **Oak Lord's** branch. Your act did not go unnoticed. You cannot seem to rid yourself of the whistle either.                                                                    |
| **17**  | The **Dawn Brigade** did your family a service and gave you a dried blood-red flower as proof. If the flower turns white, it means the favor is owed.                                                            |
| **18**  | An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left one day with hardly a note, leaving behind only **a miniature lute**. Something rattles inside.                                   |
| **19**  | You trespassed on a Fey lord's grove. To be allowed to leave, you must give up something of great importance to you. Take an **ornate dagger** with a gemstone pommel.                                           |
| **20**  | One of your ancestors wronged a moss witch, cursing their bloodline. Mirrors always break with your reflection, but its shards can reveal illusion.                                                              |

## Omens

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **d20** | **Omen**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **1**   | The once rich waters of a life-giving river have turned black and putrid, tainting the land and sickening those who drink from it. A village elder points to some recent desecration as the cause, but most do not heed her words.                                       |
| **2**   | It feels like winter has arrived too quickly this year, frost and snows making their appearance much earlier than expected. There is talk of a pattern to the frost found in windows, ponds, and cracks in the ground. It looks almost like a map.                       |
| **3**   | A thick, unnatural fog has descended upon an ancient and holy grove, and is slowly expanding. It is said to be the work of a great forest spirit, angered by nearby deforestation.                                                                                       |
| **4**   | The night sky grows dimmer each evening, as if stars are disappearing one by one. Reports talk of deadly creatures crawling up from **The Roots** and attacking villagers.  Scholars are urging calm, but the rumors are spreading like wildfire.                        |
| **5**   | The songbirds of **The Woods** have fallen eerily silent as of late. Hunters claim that a spectral figure has been spotted wandering the forest, gazing longingly at any it encounters.                                                                                  |
| **6**   | Strange, tear-shaped stones have been found throughout the region, sparking a "gold rush" of sorts that has drawn jewelers and thieves alike. The locals believe they are the tears of the earth itself, weeping for a great tragedy yet to come.                        |
| **7**   | Swarming pests gnaw away at the edges of your dreams, portending a grim future harvest. Farmers speak of a loud buzzing sound emanating from deep within The Woods.                                                                                                      |
| **8**   | In your village there lies a mother tree. They say it has always been there, holding the town's secrets in its boughs and roots. Recently it began bleeding red sap, and the elders are worried. Take a **leaf** from the tree. It turns a deep red when danger is near. |
| **9**   | The moon turns a deep crimson, bathing the night in an eerie, blood-red light. Some say it heralds a time of chaos and strife, as the boundaries between **The Woods** and the mortal realm grow thin.                                                                   |
| **10**  | You found a wounded beast in the forest, but chose to ignore it. You see it everywhere now, but only when you're alone. It looks sad, but not angry.                                                                                                                     |
| **11**  | A night-blooming flower once thought extinct is sprouting up throughout **The Woods**. Its scent is intoxicating, but also causes vivid nightmares.                                                                                                                      |
| **12**  | Rumors are that the local livestock have grown increasingly agitated and unmanageable as of late. An old shephard says its due to an unsettling howl that echoes from **The Woods** each full moon.                                                                      |
| **13**  | Swarms of insects are fleeing from **The Woods** in droves, destroying any wooden structures they come across. The sound of their wings hum a familiar tune as they pass overhead, like a forgotten nursery rhyme.                                                       |
| **14**  | Hunters talk of a curse that befalls any who kill a white-frocked beast; soon after, they are found dead in their homes. Those that eat the creatures meet no such fate. There are fewer and fewer creatures to hunt, each day now.                                      |
| **15**  | Folks are saying that a faint laughter can be heard, echoiing out of wells all over **The Cobbles**. At night, they say it sounds like sobbing, instead.                                                                                                                 |
| **16**  | The constellations have slowly started shifting in the night sky, forming unfamiliar patterns that have stargazers and sages perplexed. Even the animals seem disturbed.                                                                                                 |
| **17**  | An ancient tree at the heart of the sleepy village has suddenly withered and died, despite showing no signs of disease. After its trunk was cut, a bloody hand was found in its core.                                                                                    |
| **18**  | Statues throughout **The Cobbles** have been weeping tears of blood each month, and no babies have been born for a bit longer than the elders think possible. Save for one, whisked away by the authorities for its own safety.                                          |
| **19**  | Local fauna are behaving oddly, with reports of animals acting out of character, displaying heightened aggression, or fleeing the area entirely. Hunters talk of a shadowy figure that roams **The Woods**, driving the animals mad.                                     |
| **20**  | Border towns have become riotous in recent weeks, after multiple claims of a red-robed figure appearing in their children's dreams, uttering the same warning: A fire is coming, and it will consume them all.                                                           |

## Inventory

- Characters have a total of ten inventory slots, but can only carry four items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each PC starts with a **backpack** that can hold up to six slots. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment. 
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. When ten slots are filled, the character becomes _deprived_. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

### Item Size

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated. 

- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. These items are rarely useful mechanically. 
- _Bulky_ items take up two slots. Armor, two-handed weapons, treasure, and some Relics.
- At the **Warden's** discretion, some smaller items (e.g. a deck of cards, dice) can be _bundled_ with one or more additional items, occupying only one slot.

### Currency

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). 
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and takes no slots.
- Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.
- Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.
