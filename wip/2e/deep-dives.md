# Deep Dives

## Deep Dive: Wilderness Exploration

## Time

Travel time in Cairn is counted in **Watches**. However, as each **watch** is divided into an eight-hour segment, and most parties elect to spend at least one **watch** resting (typically at night), one can use "days" as a shorthand for travel. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four **watches** of travel, the party will need to travel for _at least_ two days to arrive at their destintation. 

## Adjusting Travel Speed 

The **default travel** speed is a single **watch** between two **points**. It is defined as a short, unmolested journey on foot along a **maintained road**, during normal weather. This rate is doubled for **trails**, and tripled when travelling **off-road**. Terrain and weather difficulty can severly slow down the party's movement, as can injured party members or a travelling with a convoy. Horses, guides, and maps can increase the rate of travel as well. The Warden should weigh all of these factors when determining how much time it takes to travel between one or more **points**. 

## Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential **points** of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each **point**, noting obvious roads and trails. If there are no obvious routes between one or more **points**, denote those as "off-road". 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accpimtomg for the **default** travel speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

### Written Example

In this example we'll be using a map made with [Watabou's](https://watabou.itch.io/) terrific [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) generator.

A party of 3 PCs (**Leib**, **Konstin**, and **Gar**) are plotting a journey to an ancient ruin deep in the forests of **Ein Eyton**. They plan to walk by foot. 
The forest (at **3**) is separated from the party's present location (the village of **Rudbat**, at **1**) by the neighboring **Range of Deshe** (at **2**), a short distance away. 

The **Warden** explains that travelling on the forgiving roads from the village to the hills will require only a single **watch**, but that it will take three _additional_ **watches** for the party to complete their journey to the forest, assuming they spend one **watch** sleeping. 

The party accepts this route, plotting their route: one **watch** to reach the hills (_morning_), one **watch** partway through the hills (_afternoonh_), then another **watch** sleeping (the **Making Camp** action) at (_night_). The party would spend the following day's _morning_ **watch** travelling to their final destination. On the first day of travel, the **Warden** rolls a 3 on the **Weather** table (**Fall**: _Cool and foggy_). 

For their first **watch**, the party chooses the **Travel** action, taking the road through the farmlands and to the hills. The terrain, weather, and current party status indicates that the **Difficulty** level is **Easy**. The party is able to travel with no forseeable problems, so the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is an **Encounter**. The **Warden** explains that the party crosses paths with an NPC travelling South, who gives them a piece of advice: "_Avoid the hills, there are bandits about_!" The party notes this and moves on, arriving in the **Range of Deshe** after lunchtime. They rest near a streambed, stepping off the dusty road for the first time.

For the party's second **watch**, the **Warden** explains that this area is peppered with small rocks and uneven hills, setting the terrain **Difficulty** to **Tough**. Worse yet, without a guide the party might easily lose their way! The players discuss whether it would be better to spend a **watch** exploring the area, perhaps even finding a faster (and safer) way through. 

The party agrees that arriving at their destination sooner is worth the risk, and proceeds with the **Travel** action again. The players discuss how to avoid **Getting Lost**, checking to see if anyone in the party has knowledge of the area, relevant experience, or a map. They do not, so the **Warden** rolls a d6. The result is not a **1** or a **2**, and the party moves on as planned.

The **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table, and the result is **Environment**. The **Warden** explains that a short while after entering the hills, the ground became much more demanding to cross. Small rocks turned into large crags, the hills to pits and mini-craters. The party now has a choice: push forward, spending a **Fatigue** to keep their current speed, or slow down, adding an additional **watch** of travel to their journey. They agree to push forward, each character adding a **Fatigue** to their inventory. Had they chosen to walk slower it may have been safer, but they would have an additional half-day of walking to do tomorrow.

As night descends, the party finds a large, rocky, outcropping that would work as a suitable shelter. There is no water nearby, but this location should be sufficient for their current needs. They agree to **Make Camp** as their final **watch**, choosing a **Watch Rotation** that should allow all party members a decent rest, and a chance to shed any **Fatigue** they have. Each party member consumes a ration, and the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is a **Sign**. The **Warden** describes the flickering ghost of a torchlight in the distance. Could it be another party, or perhaps bandits, or even a dangerous creature on the prowl?

The party rests, erasing their **Fatigue**. They mark their current location on the map, noting that should everything go well the following day, they should only have to spend one **watch** to arrive at the ruins of **Ein Eyton** by the _afternoon_.
