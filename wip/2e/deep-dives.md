# Deep Dives

## Wilderness Exploration

## Time

Travel time in Cairn is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third watch of the day resting, one can use "days" as a shorthand for travel. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four watches of travel, the party will need to travel for _at least_ two days to arrive at their destination. 

### Adjusting Travel Speed 

_Normal_ travel speed is defined as a short, unmolested journey on foot along a maintained road, with fair weather. A party walking by foot can travel between two connected points at _Normal_ travel speed in a single watch. Add an additional watch for trails, and add _two_ additional watches when travelling over wild terrain. 

Difficult terrain and bad weather can slow down the party's movement, as can caring for an injured party member or travelling with a convoy. Conversely, horses, guides, and local maps can increase the rate of travel. The Warden should weigh all of these factors when determining how much time it takes to travel between one or more points, adding additional watches whenever necessary.

## Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential points of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each point, noting obvious roads and trails. Indicate any sites that lack connecting routes to other points. 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the party's speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

### Pointcrawl Example

The travel times between each point were determined as follows:

- Assume that the party is travelling by foot, and that _Normal_ travel speed takes a single watch when moving between two connected points.
- The journey between points **1** to **2** takes 3 watches:  
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountain and the grasslands.
  - Add one watch for the _Tough_ mountain terrain.
- The journey between **2** and **4** takes only one watch due to the maintained road.
- The journey between **4** and **6** takes one watch (or less!) due to the maintained road.
- The journey between **4** and **5** takes 3 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the woods.
  - Add one watch for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey to **3** should be at least four watches from any adjacent point:
  - Points **1**, **2**, or **4** are closest.


A party of 3 PCs (**Leib**, **Konstin**, and **Gar**) are plotting a journey to an ancient ruin deep in the forests of **Ein Eyton** (**5**). 
They ask the Warden how long it will take the party to travel there from their present location, the village of **Rudbat** (**1**). The Warden collates the following information:
