# Good Dungeon Design

## Entrances/Exits
  - Create multiple entrances and exits and add meaningful information to doorways to to help players avoid feeling railroaded.
  
## Purpose
  - Demonstrates the original inhabitants, design, or goal of the dungeon. Displays its age and current use.
  - Consider was it used for, and what is it used for now. 
  - Identify what it was designed to keep out.
  
## Levels
  - Can represent danger gradation and thematic intent.
  - Should push the players to balance the risk of continuing with the potential reward.
  
## Layout
  - Incorporate loops for non-linear exploration.
  - Avoid tree-like structures with dead ends.
  - Form a network of interconnected rooms and corridors.
  - Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

## Verticality
  - Makes mapping more complex.... but also more fun
  - Add tall rooms, and climbable structures.
  - Give players things to drop on to/from
  - Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through
  
## Secret Areas
  - Design hidden zones for players to discover.
  - Provide subtle clues that say "something is off here"
  - Have at least one place that the players may never find
  
## Room Varieties
  - Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions.
  - Use architectural motifs to connect rooms thematically.
  - Should be easy to describe, map, and recall.
  
## Tactical Areas
  - Include zones that offer strategic advantages.
  - Design chokepoints, elevated spots, and other tactical features.
  - Provides a means for players to gather information discreetly.

## Treasure
  - Ensure there's something valuable to seek.
  - Offer diverse forms of treasure, including knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts.
  - Infuse narrative elements into the treasure.
  
## Challenges
  - Incorporate threats and adversaries.
  - Use monsters and obstacles to tell the dungeon's story.

## Danger
  - Create a sense of peril without making it unbeatable.
  - Label overtly dangerous areas and creatures.
  - Ensure nearly all combats can be avoided or escaped from.
  
## Paths
  - Offer multiple routes for diverse experiences.
  - Enable player agency by allowing them to exploit its geography.
  - Balance between branching paths and necessary linearity.
  
## Interaction
  - Include NPCs or creatures for players to engage with.
  - Use NPCs to deepen the dungeon's narrative and offer role-playing opportunities.
