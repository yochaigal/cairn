# How Does Knowledge And Perception Work?

## Introduction

Cairn differs from many modern roleplaying games by not including mechanics for knowledge or expertise. By contrast, it is assumed that a character has the necessary knowledge so long as it can be justified in the fiction. Similarly, there are no mechanics that govern a character's perception or ability to "detect" important details in their environment. Instead, the Warden should provide unlimited relevant information about every detail a character can perceive with their basic senses.

## Knowledge

Character knowledge is limited only by what can be explained by elements in the fiction. If it is known that a PC comes from an impoverished background and learned how to survive by any means necessary, then their player may argue that their character is better able track down a notable NPC hiding in the slums. They may know whom to speak to and what sorts of trades might be required to collect the information they need about their target's whereabouts. 

If a character has no justifiable knowledge of a subject, then they simply do not know anything about it! However, the Warden may decide to roll the **Die of Fate** to determine if the character has a chance of knowing _something_. The higher the result, the more they might (reasonably) know.

### Relics

When a character first acquires a Relic they are not familiar with, they can either spend time learning more about it (using a Downtime action) or experiment with it. The latter carries some dangers, and may even require a successful WIL save to avoid negative consequences. However, it is often more interesting to allow the player to ask as many questions as they like about it, and (eventually) to simply _tell them how it works_.

## Perception

When informing the players of what their PCs can perceive the Warden should provide maximal sensory information pertaining to the objects, characters, dangers, and interactive elements in the given situation. Consider what can be gained by limiting what the PCs know or do not know. Do secrets help create interesting choices and decision points? Do they raise interesting questions? Do they give the players a sense of control over their own actions? The answer to these questions is almost always an emphatic _No_. 

Players should feel that the consequences of their character's actions are _earned_, and that they are _deserved_, even if the results aren't always in their favor. True agency comes from providing the players with everything they need to know to make an interesting decision, even if that is simply asking a question about what their character might perceive. 

Take for example the followed keyed location:

A colony of **bees** furiously circle a massive hive hanging from the branch of a large oak tree. A **man** observes in the shadows beneath the tree, and a rusted **sword** lies on the ground not far from the tree.

- **Bees**: Their buzzing is nearly deafening, creating a wall of sound around the tree.
  - The hive is dripping with honey. It is delicious, and mundane.
  - Any attempt to take honey from the hive is met with an aggressive response from the colony [3 HP, 3 STR, 12 DEX, 4 WIL, sting (d6), _detachment_].
- **Man**: Leans against a long staff, his gaze fixed on the hive. He appears unfazed by the swarm. 
  - The man is a magical illusion created by the beekeeper as a means to drive away any potential predators. He will not react to any direct stimuli.
  - If the hive is damaged in any way, the man will scream very loudly, then disappear.
- **Sword**: Shoe prints in the earth lead towards it, but stop abruptly a few feet away. 
  - The weapon belongs to the skeleton buried just beneath the earth. It is a regular short sword (d6), strangely preserved.
  - Bloodvines [3 HP, 4 STR, 13 DEX, 1 WIL, tendrils (d6, _blast_)] attack anyone that steps close to the sword, sapping 1 STR per round from their target (STR save to escape after the first round).

In this example there are three potential dangers: the bees, the man, and the Bloodvine plant. The danger from bees is more obvious, as the PCs can clearly see the danger and are familiar with bees already. The man is an unknown entity and could be friend or foe, while the Bloodvines are hidden, and act as a sort of trap. The Warden should therefore communicate exactly what the PCs can see, hear, and smell. 

The PCs will likely try to interact with the man first, or perhaps ask questions about the sword, as these are both fairly passive ways to engage with the scene. When the PCs realize that the man does not respond, they may try to get a closer look or perhaps toss a rock in his direction (avoiding the hive), and so on. If the PCs ask questions about the sword or try to interact with it, the Warden should tell them about the shoe prints in the grass right away. 

If the PCs decide to engage with the bee hive, the Warden should "warn" them with a hint of some kind: the bees begin to fly in a more aggressive manner, or the noise they create gets louder, and so on. It is up to the players whether to ignore the clues in front of them and continue, or to stop and ask questions.
