# Downtime

Between game sessions, players may utilize the following procedures to research a question, follow-up on a lead, improve a skill, or build a relationship. Only one action is possible at a time, and some actions will require multiple steps to complete. These actions may not be taken if the PC is not in a safe space, or while healing/recovering. **Downtime Actions** (including WIL saves) cannot be taken if there is risk of significant _harm_ to a character. 

> Note: Unless otherwise noted, Rations and daily upkeep are not tracked during **Downtime**.

## Milestones

Some **Downtime Actions** require multiple steps to complete. In these cases, the Warden then provides 1-3 **Milestones** that the player can tick off as they progress towards their goal. Most **Milestone** requires a single **Downtime Action** to accomplish, and potentially their own unique **Cost** as well.

- **Milestones** are "zoomed-out" activities that are both abstract and non-interactive.
- The Warden _may_ provide the player with multiple "paths" to accomplishing their goals, each with their own unique **Milestones**. 
- Over time, the **Warden** may add new **Milestones** or remove others entirely, depending on the events of the fiction.  

### Costs

At a minimum, every **Milestone** costs a single **Downtime Action**. If a character cannot pay the **Cost**, they may have to find some other way to achieve their goal. A few examples of **Cost**: 
- **Gold**: Direct payment of gold from a character's inventory.
- **Resources**: Non-monetary costs, such as material goods, specific common items, and so on. 
- **Reputation**: Betting on a character's renown, personality, presence, social connections, etc.
- **Loss**: Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, a **Relic**, etc.   

Some **Costs** can be reduced or disregarded through character skills, connections, or force of will. For example, a PC may have already acquired the necessary reputation to gain access to a renowned institution, and thus the **cost** is abated. On the other hand, another character may not be so lucky, and must rely on their force of personality instead. In this case, the Warden should state the risk (a permanent ban on entry, a loss of reputation, etc.). The PC then makes a **WIL** save; on a success the cost is either reduced or eliminated entirely. 

## Downtime Actions

### Research

A character answers a single question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action the player must have a clearly formulated question they'd like to answer, and a **Source** of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a **Source**, then they can spend a **Downtime Action** trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. 

#### Questions

As always, the question must come from an experience that occured during play. Some example questions:
- "Where is the **Lost Temple of East Nipoor**?" 
- "Who in **Fortune City** might know how to crack an ancient vault?"
- "Where can I find the cure to **curly sickness**?" 

#### Sources

A **Source** is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs.   Some example of **Sources**:  
- **Kewr the Mouth**, a frequent contact for the **Conclave of Merchants**. Despite their excellent relationship with this faction, asking for help in an illicit activity might come at a high cost.
- A **Woodwose** who makes his home deep in the **Forest of Knives**. The party encountered him in an earlier expedition, and the encounter did not end well. Still, he is said to know the nature of every herb and their healing properties.
- The **Temple of Puppets**, a nomadic circus troupe who have travelled the known and unknown lands. The party assisted one of their members during the **Rain of Fire**, when even the creatures of the Wood were were preparing to flee their homes. If anyone has heard of forgotten places, it's them.

Once a question is posed and an appropriate **Source** has been identified, the **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**. 

#### Example: Finding a lost Relic

A player learns of a holy Relic of great power, rumored to protect the bearer from harm, or even death itself. They proclaim that they'd like to _learn the Relic's location_. They also indicate a potential **Source**: the **Library of Faded Colors** in the timeless city of **Dropsilli**. The Warden then provides the following outline:

"The trip is only possible by riverboat, and takes two days (20gp round trip). Also, the librarians there are notoriously snooty and will not accept outsiders without a proper introduction. You will likely need to spend up to FOUR non-consecutive **Downtime Actions** to complete your research, and will thus be unable to participate in every play session." The player accepts this plan, but adds that they'd like to bring along a letter of introduction, signed by a powerful Count they'd met in a previous adventure. The Warden agrees, but adds that the Count does not simply accept visitors unannounced: the PC will need to spend one **Action** simply setting up a meeting. The Warden then creates five **Milestones**:

   - [ ] Formally request a meeting with the Count.
   - [ ] Secure a letter of recommendation.
   - [ ] Travel to **Dropsilli** and be granted access to the library. [Cost: **Gold**, **Reputation**].
   - [ ] Research the location of the Relic.
   - [ ] Return home. [Cost: **Gold**].

The player agrees, and suggests that for their first **Action**, their character decides not to waste any time with formalities, instead choosing to force their way into the Count's office to demand the letter. The Warden agrees, explaining that if things go badly, their reputation with the Count might suffer and they could lose out on the letter entirely! The player makes a **WIL** save for their character: a **success**! The Warden describes how the character, "used wit and bravado to remind the Count of their greet deeds together, retrieving not only his letter but a pre-paid ticket for the riverboat!" The player marks off the first two **Milestones**. 

The character joins the party for another adventure, and upon returning to a safe haven, they choose to continue with their quest. The **Warden** informs the player that if they leave their home base, they will not be able join the party on their next adventure. They will however be able to take another **Downtime Action** during this time. They agree, and the **Warden** tells them, "You make your way to the city with little fanfare. The librarians welcome you, impressed by the letter you carry." They player marks off another **Milestone**. 
 
Another session of play occurs, during which time the PC does not participate, and chooses to take another **Downtime Action** for their research. The Warden says, "You spend a day and a night researching your subject, narrowly avoiding the wrath of the ever-present librarians. Finally, you uncover a snippet from an old text referencing the Relic. It indicates that the Relic was buried with its last known bearer, a priest of some note. The grave is somewhere in the **Ruins of Abbulahia**, an abandoned city deep in the swamps to the South.” The player marks off the fourth **Milestone**. 
 
The other players complete their play session, and choose their own **Downtime Actions**. The player announces that during this period their character takes another **Downtime Action** to hurriedly return to their friends. The **Warden** agrees, and the player marks off the final **Milestone**. 

### Self Improvement

A character can improve their skills with an item or ability, with clear narrative or mechanical results. They might be interested in dealing greater damage with a particular weapon, decreasing their chances of getting lost in rough weather, or learn to read the languages of the ancients. A PC might spend multiple **Downtime Actions** sparring with a particular weapon, improving their skills week by week. Or they may need to travel to the home of a distant sage, improving themselves through short but intense study.

The player must describe precisely what they'd like to improve, and a **Master** whom they might train with. And of course, the character's inspiration to improve should come from an experience in play. The **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**. 

Examples:  
- Blade expertise: When wielding a sword, the damage die is increased from d6 to d8.
- Improved fishing: d6 Rations are gathered when taking the Supply **Action** near healthy sources of water.
- Scholarly wisdom: The texts and signage of ancient temples and cities are finally intelligible, and understanding their Relics far easier.

#### Example: Skill with a Spear

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their character's skill at the spear. The Warden indicates that they may hire a local **Master** (a veteran soldier) to help them train (30gp per session). The improvements will be gradual, requiring a week of practice. However, if they complete their training their attacks with spears would be **d10** instead of **d8**. In total, it will take 7 **Downtime Actions** to complete their training. The Warden then creates the following **Milestones** for each session:

  - [ ] Session One. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice.
  - [ ] Session Two. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice.
  - [ ] Session Three. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice.
  - [ ] Session Four. [Cost: **Gold**].

The player agrees, and pays the required gold for the first session. Over the next 2 months of play, the Warden indicates how much time has passed in the game world, and the player spends a **Downtime Action** (and/or gold) to practice alone, or train with the **Master**. Occasionally the character was unable to pay the cost: either because they lacked **Time** to practice, or because the party left their city (and the trainer) for longer periods. 

After marking off their fourth **Milestone**, the player felt their character was cocky enough to skip their practice (including the requisite **Downtime Action**), and that they'd like to show off their skills to the trainer. The Warden asked the player to make a WIL save, cautioning that they may lose time and progress if they fail. The player rolled, and **failed**. The Warden explained that skipping practice left the trainer unimpressed. The character makes _no_ progress, and loses money spent on the trainer. The player gruntingly agrees to not try that again. Weeks later, the player marks off the final **Milestone**, and the Warden awards them with an improved skill at the spear: d10 damage in combat. 

#### Studying with a Master

During play, a player learns about a powerful sage living at the **Southern Border**, between the rivers **Alcquat** and **Durang**, rumored to have extensive knowledge in outdoor survival, wilderness mapping, and more! The player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _navigating a wilderness location_, in the hopes that it will decrease their chances of getting lost while travelling. 

However, the **Warden** explains that this **Master** is also known for having a difficult contenance, rejecting new pupils for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Success would mean unparalleled knowledge in wilderness survival, but training will be a long, drawn-out process: at least a month of training. The Warden goes on to explain that it is unlikely the player's character will be able to join the party in the next session, which begins in just a few days within the game-world. The player agrees, as they are likely going to miss the next two play sessions anyway. The Warden puts together the following **Milestones**:

- [ ] Journey to the **Southern Border** and meet the **Master**. [Cost: **Reputation**]
- [ ] Training Week 1.
- [ ] Training Week 2.
- [ ] Training Week 3.
- [ ] Return home.

The Warden narrates the character's journey South. Upon arrival, the Warden rolls on the [Reaction](/wip/2e/core-rules#reactions) table to determine the master's countenance: **Kind**! Fortunately for the character, the master was in a good mood. The player marks off both the journey and the meeting **Milestones**. Over the course of the following weeks, the player marks off each week of training, as time passes in-game. With each passing week, the character learns to forage, navigate, and track in the wilderness. Once a full month of in-game time has passed, the player marks off their final **Milestone** of training, then asks if they can make a WIL save to return home faster. The Warden explains that this is no longer necessary: their newfound skills in tracking, exploring, mapping and survival cut the travel time in half! The Warden explains the added benefits from this experience:

- When taking the **Travel** action, the odds of getting less are one step down (e.g. 4-in-6 becomes 2-in-6). 
- When travelling _alone_, they treat **Tough** terrain as **Normal** if they've travelled there before.
- When exploring, the character accurately depicts natural geographic formations on a map after only one visit. 
- When **Foraging**, the character collects d6 rations.

### Strengthen a Tie

#### Example: Faction alliance 

During a play session, a player character became friendly with the **Seneschal** of the **Order of the Helm**. Impressed by their actions, the PC is asked if they would like to join the _Order_. The player agrees, and the Warden provides the following options:

1. Join the _Order_ as a _Protector_, one of the lowest ranking members in the _Order_. The position has no distinct requirements, pays a stipend, and has its own fraternal benefits.
2. Formally pledge allegiance to the _Order_, taking their Oath and embracing their cause. Besides the more obvious requirements, the character can never reveal their face to any living creature so long as they serve. There will be a ceremony, and perhaps a trial. Membership comes with many benefits, some potentially magical.

The player chooses option #1: present themselves to the _Order_ as a volunteer. The Warden provides the following **Milestones** as requirements to reach **Protector** status:

  - [ ] Travel to an _Order_ outpost. 
  - [ ] Train.
  - [ ] Return from the outpost. 
  - [ ] Volunteer for a preliminary Mission.
  - [ ] Final Demonstration. 

The Warden says that travelling to the outpost and returning will take a week of game time, and will require three **Downtime Actions** to complete. The player agrees, as the party is not due to go out again for a two weeks of in-game time. The **Warden** describes the character's experience training with the _Order_ and the journey home. At the end, the player marks three **Milestones**. 

A few weeks later, the player asks if their character can volunteer for a _Order_ mission. The **Warden** informs the player that there is an upcoming escort through the swamps of **Falal-hall**, but as this **Milestone** carries some risk the scenario will need to play out in a regular session. The player (along with the rest of the group) agrees. In the next play session, the entire party joins the mission, which results in a nearly fatal encounter with a bog demon. Although these events occured outside the scope of Downtime, the player still marks off their next **Milestone**. 

The Warden then describes the formal presentation that all cadets must endure: a two-day affair of training exercises, celebrations, and finery. The player suggests that perhaps the invitation from their **Seneschal** friend might help move things along, without all the pomp and circumstance? The Warden agrees that this is at least possible, though the consequences might be embarrassing. The player rolls a **WIL** save: a **success**! The Warden announces that once word of their friendship with a higher-ranking official was confirmed, they were hastily thrown a uniform, a new shield (+1 Armor), and a fine short sword (d6) along with full **Protector** status. Along with support at any _Order_ outpost, the character receives a stipend of 5gp per day while working on _Order_ business. They are ordered to check in with their local **Precept** once a week whenever possible. They cannot refuse a direct order, but all _Order_ missions are otherwise optional. They are also expected to answer the call to battle when it comes.
