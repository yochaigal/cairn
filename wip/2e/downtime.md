# Downtime

Between game sessions, players may utilize the following Downtime procedures to improve a skill, research a question, follow-up on a lead, build a relationship, and more. Downtime is possible only if the PCs are in a safe space, and may not be possible while **Healing**. 

## Downtime Overview

- A player articulates precisely _how_ they intend to achieve their goal. The Warden then provides 1-5 **Milestones** that the player can tick off as they progress towards their goal. The Warden _may_ provide the player with multiple _choices_, each with their own unique **Milestones**.
- Most **Milestones** will come at a cost: overcoming an obstacle, spending a resource, traveling a great distance, time, etc. Some may deliver their own unique benefits as well. 
- A PC may attempt to complete as many **milestones** as they like, provided they can meet the cost. A PC may make a WIL save to soften a cost, or even eliminate it entirely. On a fail they make _no_ progress, and the Warden describes any potential fallout. New milestones may be added, or the goal may need to be abandoned entirely.

> Events that occur during a regular session of play may change the stakes of Downtime activities by adding or removing costs, **Milestones**, or even entire goals. Conversely, events that occur during Downtime may impact the events of a play session! **Milestones** that directly endanger the life of a character should occur during a regular play session.

## Costs

The following are typical costs. This list is in no way exhaustive.

- **Time**: The most common cost. Counted in days or weeks. Typical for travel, training, study, etc.
- **Gold**: Direct payment of gold from a character's inventory.
- **Resources**: Non-monetary costs, such as material goods, specific common items, and so on. 
- **Reputation**: Betting on a character's reknown, personality, presence, etc.
- **Loss**: Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, a **Relic**, etc.   

## Examples

### Finding a lost Relic

A player learns of a holy Relic of great power, rumored to protect the bearer from harm, or even death itself. They proclaim that they'd like to _learn the Relic's location_. The Warden then provides the following outline:

"You may travel to the timeless city of **Dropsilli**, where the walls fell. There is a well-known library there with more text on sacred objects than in any other. The trip is only possible by riverboat, and takes three day's travel. Also, the librarians there are notoriously snooty." They also explain that the character may run the danger of being separated from their party, as the next session begins only eight in-world days from now.

 The player accepts this plan, but adds that they'd like to bring along a letter of introduction, signed by a powerful Count they'd met in a previous adventure. The Warden agrees, but adds that they will need to spend one additional day retrieving the letter. The Warden then creates five **Milestones**:

   - [ ] Secure a letter of recommendation. [Cost: **Time**].
   - [ ] Travel to **Dropsilli**. [Cost: **Time**, **Gold**].
   - [ ] Be granted access to the library. [Cost: **Reputation**].
   - [ ] Discover information on the location of the Relic. [Cost: **Time**].
   - [ ] Return to your party. [Cost: **Time**].

 The player feels that they can likely shave off a day by having their character force their way into the Count's office, demanding a letter. The Warden agrees, explaining that if things go badly, their reputation with the Count might suffer. The player makes a **WIL** save for their character: a **success**! The Warden describes how the character, "used wit and bravado to remind the Count of their greet deeds together, retrieving not only his letter but a pre-paid ticket for the riverboat!" The player marks off one **Milestone**, and tells the Warden they'd like to begin their journey. 
 
 They agree to pay the cost (only **Time**). They mark off another **Milestone**, and the notes how much time has passed. The Warden tells them, "You make your way to the city with little fanfare. Do you present your letter of introduction to the librarians?" The player agrees, and the Warden says, "They welcome you, impressed by the letter you carry." The player marks off a _third_ **Milestone**, and adds that they'd like to begin their research immediately. 
 
 The Warden indicates that due to the size of the library, it will take at least three days to find information on their subject, and that they would be late to meet their party. Considering this, the player adds that they'd like to make a WIL save to see if their character can find what they're looking for any faster. The Warden reminds the player that these librarians are very strict; any failure to adhere to their rules will result in an immediate ban from the library. 
 
 The player pushes ahead anyway, once again making a **WIL** save. They roll a **success**! The Warden says, "You spend a day and a night researching your subject, narrowly avoiding the wrath of the ever-present librarians. Finally, you uncover a snippet from an old text referencing the Relic. It indicates that the Relic was buried with its last known bearer, a priest of some note. The grave is somewhere in the **Ruins of Abbulahia**, an abandoned city deep in the swamps to the South.” The player marks off the final **Milestone**, and announces that their character hurriedly returns to their friends. 

### Mastery of the spear

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their character's skill at the spear. The Warden indicates that they may hire a **Veteran Soldier** (30gp per session) to help them train. The improvements will be gradual, requiring a week of practice for every session. However, if they complete their training their attacks with spears would be **d10** instead of **d8**. The Warden then creates the following **Milestones** for each session:

  - [ ] Session One. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice. [Cost: **Time**].
  - [ ] Session Two. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice. [Cost: **Time**].
  - [ ] Session Three. [Cost: **Gold**].
  - [ ] Week of Practice. [Cost: **Time**].

The player agrees, and pays the required gold for the first session. Over the next 2 months of play sessions, the Warden indicates how much time has passed in the game world, whether the character was able to pay the cost for each subsequent milestone. Occasionally the character was unable to pay the cost: either because they lacked **Time** to practice, or because the party left their city (and the trainer) for long periods. After marking off the third **Milestone** (Session Two) the player felt their character was cocky enough to skip Practice, and that they'd like to show off their skills to the trainer. The Warden asked the player to make a WIL save, cautioning that they may injure themselves if unprepared. The player rolled, and **failed**. The Warden explained that skipping practice left the trainer unimpressed. The character makes _no_ progress, and loses money spent on the trainer. The player gruntingly agrees to not try that again. Weeks later, the player marks off the final **Milestone**, and the Warden awards them with an improved skill at the spear: d10 damage in combat. 

### Improved navigation

A player informs the Warden that they'd like to improve their skill at _navigating a wilderness location_, in the hopes that it will decrease their chances of getting lost while travelling. The Warden says, "At the **Southern Border**, between the rivers **Alcquat** and **Durang** there lives a hermit, rumored to have extensive knowledge in outdoor survival, wilderness mapping, and more! However, they are also known for having a difficult contenance, rejecting new pupils for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Success would mean unparalleled knowledge in wilderness survival and surveying; however it will be a long, drawn-out process: at least a month of training. Finally, the journey by foot will take at least four days." 

The Warden goes on to explain that it is unlikely the player's character will be able to join the party in the next session, which begins in just a few days within the game-world. The player agrees, as they are likely going to miss the next two play sessions anyway. The Warden puts together the following **Milestones**:

  - [ ] Journey to the **Southern Border**. [Cost: **Resources**, **Time**] 
  - [ ] Meet the **Master**. [Cost: **Reputation**]
  - [ ] Training Week 1. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Training Week 2. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Training Week 3. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Training Week 4. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Return home. [Cost: **Time**] 

The player pays the resources required for travel (3 Rations) and the Warden narrates the character's journey South. Upon arrival, the Warden rolls on the [Reaction](/wip/2e/core-rules#reactions) table to determine the master's countenance: **Kind**! Fortunately for the character, the master was in a good mood. The player marks off both the journey and the meeting **Milestones**. Over the course of the following real-life weeks and month, the player marks off each week of training, as time passes in-game. With each passing week, the character learns to forage, navigate, and track in the wilderness. Once a full month of in-game time has passed, the player marks off their final **Milestone** of training, then asks if they can make a WIL save to return home faster. The Warden explains that this is no longer necessary: their newfound skills in tracking, exploring, mapping and survival cut the travel time in half! The Warden explains the added benefits from this experience:

- When taking the **Travel** action, the odds of getting less are one step down (e.g. 4-in-6 becomes 2-in-6). 
- When travelling _alone_, they treat **Tough** terrain as **Normal** if they've travelled there before.
- When exploring, the character accurately depicts natural geographic formations on a map after only one visit. 
- When **Foraging**, the character collects d6 rations. 

### Faction alliance 

During a play session, a player character became friendly with the **Seneschal** for a **Faction** called the **Order of the Helm**. Impressed, they asked if the character would like to join the _Order_. The player says their character agrees, and the Warden provides the following options:

1. Join the _Order_ as a _Protector_, one of the lowest ranking members in the _Order_. It has not distinct requirements, pays a stipend, and has its own fraternal benefits.
2. Formally pledge allegiance to the _Order_, taking their Oath and embracing their cause. Besides the more obvious requirements, the character can never reveal their face to any living creature so long as they serve. There will be a ceremony, and perhaps a trial. Membership comes with many benefits, some potentially magical.

The player chooses option #1: present themselves to the _Order_ as a volunteer. The Warden provides the following **Milestones** as requirements to reach **Protector** status:

  - [ ] Travel to an _Order_ Outpost. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Train. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Volunteer For A Mission. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Final Demonstration. [Cost: **Time**]
  - [ ] Formally Join The _Order_. [Cost: Free]

The player indicates that they'd like to present themselves to the _Order_ for Training. The Warden says that travelling to the outpost will take one day, and they will remain there for a week. The player agrees, as the party is not due to go out again for a two weeks of in-game time. They mark off the first **Milestone**. After their training is complete, the player marks off the second **Milestone** and the Warden suggests the character return to the party for the next session.

A few weeks later, the player asks if their character can volunteer for a _Order_ mission. The **Warden** informs the player that there is an upcoming escort through the swamps of **Falal-hall**, but as this **Milestone** carries some risk the scenario will need to play out in a regular session. The player (along with the rest of the group) agrees. In the next play session, the entire party joins the mission, which results in a nearly fatal encounter with a bog demon. Nevertheless, the player marks off their next **Milestone**. 

The Warden then describes the formal presentation that all cadets must endure: a two-day affair of pomp and finery. The player suggests that perhaps the invitation from their **Seneschal** friend might help smooth things along? The Warden agrees that this is at least possible, though the consequences might be embarrasing. The player rolls a **WIL** save: a **success**! The Warden announces that once word of their friendship with a higher-ranking official was confirmed, they were hastily thrown a uniform, a new shield (+1) Armor, and a fine short sword (d6) along with full **Protector** status. Along with support at any _Order_ outpost, the character receives a stipend of 5gp per day while working on _Order_ business. They are ordered to check in with their local **Precept** once a week whenever possible. They cannot refuse a direct order, but all _Order_ missions are otherwise optional. They are expected to answer the call to battle when it comes.
