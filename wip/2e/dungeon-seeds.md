# Dungeon Seeds

## Overview

- Establish a theme
  - Find inspiration
  - Use examples from real life
  - Location
  - Setting
  - Entrance
  - Construction
  - History 
  - Original Use
- Create the map
  - Do it however you can do it
  - Be ready to change it - a lot
- Stock the rooms
  - [we'll get there]
- Good Keying
  - Put everything in maps (dimension, exits)
  - Numbering
  - Start with what matters most
  - Be specific
  - Ignore boring stuff
  - Only say what's happening _now_
  - Don't assume
  - Don't tell the PCs how they feel



## Principles

### Entrances/Exits
  - Create multiple entrances and exits and add meaningful information to doorways to to help players avoid feeling railroaded.
  
### Purpose
  - Demonstrates the original inhabitants, design, or goal of the dungeon. Displays its age and current use.
  - Consider was it used for, and what is it used for now. 
  - Identify what it was designed to keep out.
  
### Levels
  - Can represent danger gradation and thematic intent.
  - Should push the players to balance the risk of continuing with the potential reward.
  
### Layout
  - Incorporate loops for non-linear exploration.
  - Avoid tree-like structures with dead ends.
  - Form a network of interconnected rooms and corridors.
  - Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### Verticality
  - Makes mapping more complex... but also more fun
  - Add tall rooms, and climbable structures.
  - Give players things to drop on to/from
  - Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through
  
### Secret Areas
  - Design hidden zones for players to discover.
  - Provide subtle clues that say "something is off here"
  - Have at least one place that the players may never find
  
### Room Varieties
  - Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions.
  - Use architectural motifs to connect rooms thematically.
  - Should be easy to describe, map, and recall.
  
### Tactical Areas
  - Include zones that offer strategic advantages.
  - Design choke points, elevated spots, and other tactical features.
  - Provides a means for players to gather information discreetly.

### Treasure
  - Ensure there's something valuable to seek.
  - Offer diverse forms of treasure, including knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts.
  - Infuse narrative elements into the treasure.
  
### Challenges
  - Incorporate threats and adversaries.
  - Use monsters and obstacles to tell the dungeon's story.

### Danger
  - Create a sense of peril without making it unbeatable.
  - Label overtly dangerous areas and creatures.
  - Ensure nearly all combats can be avoided or escaped from.
  
### Paths
  - Offer multiple routes for diverse experiences.
  - Enable player agency by allowing them to exploit its geography.
  - Balance between branching paths and necessary linearity.
  
### Interaction
  - Include NPCs or creatures for players to engage with.
  - Use NPCs to deepen the dungeon's narrative and offer role-playing opportunities.

## Establish a Theme

### Initial Concept

Consider what comes to mind when you think of a dungeon: it might be at the center of an abandoned maze, a trapdoor in a ruined temple, or in a gaping crystal maw in a long-abandoned mine. Consider where the dungeon is located, and how its entrance looks. Keep that image in your mind as we establish the theme. 

> If you have already arrived at a basic concept for your dungeon by way of the Dungeon Types table in [Setting Seeds](/wip/2e/setting-seeds), you may skip ahead to the next section.

### History

Who built the dungeon? What was its originally used for? Perhaps it used to be a mill, abandoned after the war took away all the able-bodied workers. Or maybe it was once a great fort, acting as a bulwark against the creatures of the night.

### Example

Let's start with a simple dungeon concept: a former mine, sealed off to prevent further exploration. Perhaps the miners found something they could not contain, and blasted the entry shut? Maybe they even sacrificed some of their own, for "the greater good?"
