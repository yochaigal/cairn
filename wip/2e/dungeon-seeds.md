# Dungeon Seeds

## Principles

- **Purpose**: Demonstrate signs of the original inhabitants, design, or goal of the dungeon. Display its age and current use wherever possible. Consider what the dungeon was used for, and what it is used for now. Consider what was the dungeon designed to keep out? What was it designed to keep _in_?
- **Levels**: Levels should represent increased danger as well as thematic intent. Each level pushes players to weigh the potential reward vs the risk.
- **Layout**: Create multiple entrances and exits, offer multiple routes, design choke points, and provide hiding spots. Add meaningful and obvious information to doorways and exits.
- **Verticality**: Incorporate tall rooms, climbable structures, and paths that allow movement up and over obstacles.
- **Secret Areas**: Include hidden zones, ensuring at least one area might remain undiscovered but is worth finding.
- **Rooms**: Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions. Use architectural motifs to connect rooms and provide hints of what's to come. Room descriptions should be easy to map and recall.
- **Treasure**: Incorporate a variety of treasures beyond mere gold, such as knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts. Add narrative elements to treasure to increase its non-monetary value.
- **Challenges**: Create opportunities for the players to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact. Create a sense of peril without making obstacles seem unbeatable. Overtly dangerous areas and creatures should be obvious. Create combat encounters that can be avoided with critical thinking or problem-solving. Use monsters and other obstacles to help tell the dungeon's story.
- **NPCs & Factions**: Include engaging NPCs and factions with their own goals and agendas. Factions should interact with both the characters and one another, acting on their own regardless of the character's actions. Give them hierarchies and divisions that can be exploited. NPCs and monsters should communicate with the PCs, even during combat. Have them make threats, suggest compromises, or try to persuade the PCs whenever possible. 
- **The Dungeon Map**: Put boring or repetitive stuff (exits, room shapes, etc.) on the map. Obvious exits should be described using clear, distinct language. Number your rooms to help avoid confusion when referencing the map.
- **Room Keying**: Emphasize a room's most important aspects (typically obvious threats or NPCs). Describe elements that help orient the party to their surroundings. Be specific, but avoid describing how the characters should _feel_. Only describe what's happening _now_. If there is history here, the characters will discover it in play. Name each room!
- **Describing a Dungeon**: Always reiterate what is _about_ to happen. Does that flaming barrel look stable, or like it might explode? Constantly re-state the party's surroundings, where they are in physical space, and what each character's senses are detecting. 

## Creating a Dungeon

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **dungeon map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

Follow this procedure for any Dungeon POIs in your setting. Refer to the dungeon type table results from earlier, reading the results from your map. What image springs immediately to mind? Where is the dungeon is located? What does its entrance look like? Don't worry if you can't answer these questions yet. By the end of this process, you should be able to.

### History

Who built the dungeon? What was its originally used for? Perhaps it was once a great forge, capable of building the world's most powerful weapon. Or maybe it was once a burial site for ancient kings, binding their souls to the lands they once ruled. Roll on the tables below, noting the results in your notebook. Then answer the following questions: 

_"What kind of dungeon is this, and what makes it unusual?"_

_"Why was this dungeon built, how was it built, and what caused its downfall?"_

### Denizens

Most dungeons will have creatures that _live_ there, and make it their home. The following table can be used to describe the general attitude of any or all of the intelligent creatures in the dungeon. Roll on the Traits table, writing the results in your notebook. This describes the general attitude of the creatures found in the dungeon.

Meanwhile, every dungeon should have at least one NPC that stands out from all the others. These types _prefer_ the dungeon life over any other, but still act differently than their brethren. They should be NPCs that the party can interact, trade, hire, aid, and so on. These strange creatures can be deeply involved or entirely neutral towards the dungeon's other denizens and Factions.  Roll on the Traits table again, writing the results in your notebook. Then answer the following questions:

_"What do we know about the creatures and Factions that occupy the dungeon?"_

_"What are each Factions trying to achieve, and what stands in their way?"_

### Encounter Tables

[Build encounter tables.]

## Create the Map

- Roll **6-20 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the dungeon's _rooms_.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Dungeon Die Drop Table](#dungeon-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Special** room, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- If a room feels "too far" from the rest, roll another die and follow the previous process to add a new room.
- Select the room closest to the page border. This is the _entrance_ to the dungeon.
- Starting with the entrance, number each room on the dungeon map.

#### Dungeon Die Drop Table

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| **d6**  | **Room** |
| **1-2** | Lore     |
| **3-4** | Monster  |
| **4**   | Special  |
| **5-6** | Trap     |

### Draw Paths

- Starting with the entrance, create 1-4 paths between each room. 
 - Create loops, branching hallways, dead-ends, and shortcuts between rooms.
 - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
 - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Create at least two intersections (crossed lines) with no rooms in between.

### Stock the Rooms

- Roll on the relevant tables for each room, writing the results in your notebook. 
- For each room, filter the table results through the theme you generated earlier in this process. 

#### Lore

Lore rooms should build on the theme of the dungeon, provide a valuable lesson, or connect the characters with an NPC or Faction. They might create a dilemma or moral conflict that unites the party, or puts them at odds with their mission. These rooms help re-contextualize the dungeon and its overarching themes, twisting the party's perspective a bit. At the minimum these rooms act as a curiosity, adding something memorable to the dungeon delving experience beyond simple danger and puzzle-solving. Of course, the characters never know that these rooms do not contain monsters, puzzles, or other challenges. This helps increase tension in the dungeon, while offering a potential respite and opportunity for growing the narrative.

| **20**  | Workshop      | Writing       |

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature that lives in a dungeon. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not simply "waiting around" for the characters to find them, but instead have their own wants and goals, even if they are simply looking for their next meal. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

# Special

Special rooms areas are uncommon areas that feature a hidden or interactive element. This element can be a challenge, an obstacle, a puzzle, or all of the above. These rooms should offer difficult choices with long-term impacts. They might make dungeon exploration easier, but with a serious cost.

##### Puzzles

Puzzles should have: 
- Clear, actionable goals
- Obvious challenges, but not obvious solutions
- Multiple solutions, solvable with intelligence and critical thinking, not special abilities or unique tools
- Built-in clues about their origin and their effects
- Elements that reinforce the themes of the dungeon

## Dungeon Example

For this example, let's assume we are looking at a POI generated using the methods described in the Setting Seeds chapter. Our relevant results were:

- **Terrain**: _Forest_
- **Type**: _Temple_
- **Feature**: _Isolated_

### What kind of dungeon is this, and what makes it unusual?

_A remote forest temple, cut off from the world by a vast ocean of trees and shrubbery._

We then roll on the **Purpose**, **Construction**, and **Ruination** tables and get the following results:

- **Purpose**: The _Protection of rare artifacts_. Built by a _fanatical cult_. 
- **Construction**: The entrance is _between a circle of menhirs_, and its foundation is built of the very same _petrified wood_ that surrounds it.
- **Ruination**: _Divided_ (literally) by _competing rituals_.

### Why was this dungeon built, how was it built, and what caused its downfall?

_It was designed by an extremist cult of forest druids to house reality-altering Relic. Its entrance is beneath a false stone in a circle of menhirs deep in the forest. The walls and ceiling of the dungeon are built from petrified wood, as the ancient artifact affects living plants, warping them to its will. A division within the cult faced off over control of the Relic, but fell victim to their own hubris and nearly destroyed one another. When two opposing rituals collided, the temple was split in two, divided along Factional lines. The Relic was lost in the aftermath._

Continuing on to the current inhabitants of our dungeon, we get the following results (rolling for _two_ factions):

- **Denizens**: The creatures living here are _practical,_ yet _unimaginative_.
- **Faction A**: Would like to see the _destruction_ of the other faction, but are cowed by their opponent's opposition.
- **Faction B**: Seek a _redemption_ that they cannot find due to a great _tradition_.

### What do we know about the creatures and Factions that occupy the dungeon?

_The current denizens of this dungeon are the descendants of the original Factions, and are typically pragmatic about their ceaseless war, unable to imagine a way out._

### What are each Factions trying to achieve, and what stands in their way?

One Faction seeks power over the alternate reality, but under no circumstances desires the reunification of the two sides. They believe that if the original Relic were recovered, they might bend its power to destroy the other Faction. However, every attempt to plumb the temple's depths has been countered by an attack by a far more powerful opponent that watches their every move.

The other Faction feel a great sense of shame over their ancestor's actions, and believes that if they were able to reunite the two Factions, they might make things right again. They believe that if the original Relic were recovered, they might bend its power to undue they Great Split in the temple, joining the two clans. Unfortunately, a long-standing tradition states that none of their blood may seek the Relic so as to avoid the mistakes of the past.

### Conclusion

With some idea on the history, purpose, and denizens of the dungeon, we finally have our theme. Let's put it all together:  

Nestled within a dense, shrouded forest lies a temple made entirely of petrified wood. Built by a fanatical cult to protect an ancient Relic, its entrance is concealed by a false menhirs. After dueling rituals collided, the temple broke along both ideological and structural boundaries. Today the descendants of these factions still vie for control, destruction and redemption, but are hindered by power imbalances and ancient tradition.
