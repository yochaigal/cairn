## Overview

- Establish a theme
  - Find inspiration
  - Use examples from real life
  - Location
  - Setting
  - Entrance

  - Original Use
- Create the map
  - Do it however you can do it
  - Be ready to change it - a lot
- Stock the rooms
  - [we'll get there]
- Good Keying
  - Put everything in maps (dimension, exits)
  - Numbering
  - Start with what matters most
  - Be specific
  - Ignore boring stuff
  - Only say what's happening _now_
  - Don't assume
  - Don't tell the PCs how they feel

## Principles

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

### Entrances/Exits

  - Create multiple entrances and exits and add meaningful information to doorways to to help players avoid feeling railroaded.
  
### Purpose

  - Demonstrate the original inhabitants, design, or goal of the dungeon. Displays its age and current use.
  - Consider was it used for, and what is it used for now. 
  - Identify what it was designed to keep out.
  
### Levels

  - Can represent danger gradation and thematic intent.
  - Should push the players to balance the risk of continuing with the potential reward.
  
### Layout

  - Incorporate loops for non-linear exploration.
  - Avoid tree-like structures with dead ends.
  - Form a network of interconnected rooms and corridors.
  - Allows for interesting strategies, especially with combat and ambushes

### Verticality

  - Makes mapping more complex... but also more fun
  - Add tall rooms, and climbable structures.
  - Give players things to drop on to/from
  - Lets them go up and over, instead of just pushing through
  
### Secret Areas

  - Design hidden zones for players to discover.
  - Provide subtle clues that say "something is off here"
  - Have at least one place that the players may never find
  
### Room Varieties

  - Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions.
  - Use architectural motifs to connect rooms thematically.
  - Should be easy to describe, map, and recall.
  
### Tactical Areas

  - Include zones that offer strategic advantages.
  - Design choke points, elevated spots, and other tactical features.
  - Provides a means for players to gather information discreetly.

### Treasure

  - Ensure there's something valuable to seek.
  - Offer diverse forms of treasure, including knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts.
  - Infuse narrative elements into the treasure.
  
### Challenges

- Monsters and obstacles are another way to tell the dungeon's story.

### Dangers

  - Try to create a sense of peril without making obstacles seem unbeatable.
  - Overtly dangerous areas and creatures should be obvious.
  - Create combat encounters that can be avoided with critical thinking.
  
### Paths

  - Offer multiple routes.
  - Allow them to exploit a dungeon's geography.
  - Should offer a balance between branching routes and obvious linearity.
  
### Interactions

  - Include NPCs for the players to engage with.
  - Use Factions to deepen the dungeon's narrative and offer role-playing opportunities.


## Establish a Theme

### Initial Concept

Consider what comes to mind when you think of a dungeon: it might be at the center of an abandoned maze, a trapdoor in a ruined temple, or in a gaping crystal maw in a long-abandoned mine. Consider where the dungeon is located, and how its entrance looks. Keep that image in your mind as we establish the theme. 

> If you have already arrived at a basic concept for your dungeon by way of the Dungeon Types table in [Setting Seeds](/wip/2e/setting-seeds), you may skip ahead to the next section.

### History

Who built the dungeon? What was its originally used for? Perhaps it used to be a mill, abandoned after the war took away all the able-bodied workers. Or maybe it was once a great fort, acting as a bulwark against the creatures of the night.

### Factions

Dungeons (like any other setting) should have one or more Factions with their own unique agenda, obstacles, leaders, and hierarchy.  

#### Agendas

|         |                |              |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **d20** | **Goal**       | **Obstacle** |
| **1**   | Ascension      | Sacrifice    |
| **2**   | Creation       | Conflict     |
| **3**   | Destruction    | Corruption   |
| **4**   | Dominion       | Cost         |
| **5**   | Enlightenment  | Danger       |
| **6**   | Exploration    | Decay        |
| **7**   | Growth         | Discord      |
| **8**   | Innovation     | Division     |
| **9**   | Justice        | Dogma        |
| **10**  | Knowledge      | Exposure     |
| **11**  | Liberation     | Factionalism |
| **12**  | Peace          | Fear         |
| **13**  | Power          | Ignorance    |
| **14**  | Preservation   | Incompetence |
| **15**  | Protection     | Injustice    |
| **16**  | Redemption     | Isolation    |
| **17**  | Revenge        | Opposition   |
| **18**  | Survival       | Stagnation   |
| **19**  | Transformation | Tradition    |
| **20**  | Wealth         | Weakness     |

### Denizens

Most dungeons will have someone _living_ there. Someone that _prefers_ the dungeon life over any other. These should be NPCs that the party can interact, trade, hire, aid, and so on. These creatures can be deeply involved or entirely neutral towards the dungeon's Factions.

### Implementation

Let's start with a simple dungeon concept: a former mine, sealed off to prevent further exploration. Perhaps the miners found something they could not contain, and blasted the entry shut? Maybe they even sacrificed some of their own, for "the greater good?"
