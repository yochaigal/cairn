# Setting

### Summary
- A **Domain** has a **Theme**, **Scale**, **Factions**, **Terrain,** and **Details**. 
- Distance is measured in [**Travel Watches**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#travel), assuming that the party travels by foot and on maintained roads.

## Theme
Established facts about the setting. Some questions to ask: 
- How is magic in this world?
- What level of technology is it?
- How does religion function?
- Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their relative position with respect to those in power?
- What races & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
- What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?

### Example Theme
- Low-magic (magic is known but rarely understood).
- Technology is 13th or 14th century (gunpowder, longbows, some agricultural innovations, pre-printing press).
- Religion exists, but is murky and unprovable. Deities do not necessarily walk the lands, though some believe they do.
- PCs are Human-only, and are neutral towards the centers of power.
- Names & proper nouns are largely plain English. Themes are inspired by the British Isles, Germany, and Eastern Europe.

### Domain Scale
- **Small**: A single **Province** whose central hub is a large village.  The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _eight_ **Travel Watches** away.  
- **Medium**: 2-4 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large town). The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _sixteen_ **Travel Watches** away. 
- **Large**: 5-10 **Provinces** who share a central hub (typically a large city). - The distance between a settled **Detail** and the central hub is no more than _twenty-four_ **Travel Watches** away. 

## Details
- **Details** act as [**Points**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#points) for the purposes of [**Wilderness Exploration**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration).
- **Details** can be placed somewhere in the **Wilds** or somewhere in the **Settled Lands**. The **Underworld** is typically hidden or underground, and can be placed anywhere.

### The Wilds
- Ruin/Labyrinth/Derelict
- Sanctuary/Oasis/Refuge
- Outpost/Keep/Fort/Garrison

### Settled Lands
- Village
- Town
- City

### The Underworld
- Dungeon
- Cavern
- Lair

### Landmarks
- Can be placed anywhere

## Factions
- Factions rule over one or more **Details**, or even an entire **Province**. Up to 3 factions per **Province**.
- Factions have **Agendas** as well as **Powers** to help acheive them. A faction's powers reflect its influence on the world, and its ability to achieve its goals. 
- Each faction has a powerful ruler (Lord, Abbot, Warlord, Noble, Zealot), represented by one or more **Seneschals** (Knights, Priests, Warriors, Cultist).

### Faction Goals
- Factions have clear goals, typically completed in 2-4 steps. 
- Factions grow their **Power** by completing goals, which in turn accelerates the completion of their goals.
- The **domain** map should reflect the impact of goals being completed or interrupted. If the PCs do nothing, the goal succeeds automatically.
