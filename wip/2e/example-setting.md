# Example Setting

## Theme
- Low-magic (magic is known but rarely understood).
- Technology is 13th or 14th century (gunpowder, longbows, some agricultural innovations, pre-printing press).
- Religion exists, but is murky and unprovable. Deities do not necessarily walk the lands, though some believe they do.
- PCs are Human-only, and are neutral towards the centers of power.
- Names & proper nouns are largely plain English. Themes are inspired by the British Isles, Germany, and Eastern Europe.

## Domain Scale
- **Small**: One **Province** under a single ruler (**The Potentate**).

## Province: Whitefort
**Whitefort**, after its "founding" by the great ancestor of the **Earl of White**. The (now dead) locals referred to it as **The Ramparts**, but that name is long forgotten. **Hope Landing** (built around a large font of water in an otherwise brackish land) acted as a regional hub for future explorers and pioneers, but they became stymied by the wastelands to the West, and eventually settled closer to the capital city. The current ruling Faction (The **Potentate**) makes the city its center of government, while **The Will** hides in the abandoned town of **Dead Margin** on the cliffs to the Southwest.
