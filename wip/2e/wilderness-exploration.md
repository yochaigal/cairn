# Wilderness Exploration

## The Basics
- A day is divided in 3 phases of 8 hours each (morning, noon, and night).
- A single **Wilderness Action** can be chosen per phase. 
- For each night the party skips the **Make Camp** action, each PC adds one **Fatigue** to their inventory.
- At the start of each day, roll on the [**Weather**](#weather) table for the appropriate season.

#### Hex Crawls
For hexcrawls, treat each hex as 6 miles. Characters can therefore travel up to 3 hexes per day. Otherwise treat "areas" above as hexes (e.g. **Getting Lost** places you in an adjacent hex).

## Wilderness Actions
### Travel
- The party travels up to 6 miles. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance.
- A healthy person can walk up to 18 miles per day, provided they rest at least once. Horses and other mounts can increase (or decrease) travel speed.
- Difficult terrain, obstacles, and slower party members can reduce travel speed by half or more.
- The party must be careful to avoid losing their way (see [Getting Lost](#getting-lost).
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).

#### Getting Lost
- There is a 2-in-6 chance the party will get lost when traveling via difficult terrain.
- Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances of getting lost to 1-in-6.
- If the party gets lost, they may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. The **Warden** rolls on the [Cardinal Directions](#cardinal-directions) table to see where the party ends up, then rolls on the [Events Table](#events).

### Explore
The party searches for hidden any features within the current area.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- One Location/Feature is discovered.

### Supply
The party gathers food and water.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- Hunt, fish, or forage for food. Each person involved has a 3-in-6 chance of collecting 1d4 rations worth. Characters with relevant experience can increase the chances of success or negate the roll entirely. 

### **Make Camp**
The party stops to set up camp.
- A **Watch** rotation is set (typically 2 hours). If no rotation is possible, the character standing guard does not recover Fatigue and is _deprived_ until they can rest properly.
- The **Warden** rolls on the [Events Table](#events).
- Party members that were able to rest lose all their **Fatigue**.

## Tables

### Weather
Roll **1d6** on the following table to determine the weather each day.

| | | | | |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :--: |
| **d6**   | **Spring**            | **Summer**                | **Fall**               | **Winter**                |
| **1**    | Cold and windy            | Cool and sunny        | Chilly and rainy   | Freezing and clear    |
| **2**    | Cold and rainy            | Hot and sunny         | Cool and windy     | Freezing and snowy    |
| **3**    | Cool and breezy           | Warm and drizzly      | Cool and rainy     | Cold and snowy        |
| **4**    | Mild and cloudy           | Mild and stormy       | Mild and breezy    | Frigid and windy      |
| **5**    | Warm and rainy            | Hot and humid         | Chilly and foggy   | Cold and sunny        |
| **6**    | Hot and sunny             | Sweltering and clear  | Warm and cloudy    | Mild and storming     |

### Events 
Roll **1d6** and consults the table appropriate to the party’s location.

|                         |                  |             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
|  **1** |  **Encounter** | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [reactions](/cairn-srd/#reactions) if applicable. |
|  **2** | **Sign**  | The characters discover a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area.   |
|  **3** | **Locality**  | A shift in weather, terrain.   |
|  **4** | **Expiration**  | Resources are drained in some way (lost ration or broken tools).   |
|  **5** | **Exhaustion** |  The characters encounter a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional **Wilderness Action**) or adding **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties.
|  **6** | **Discovery** | The characters find food, treasure, or other useful resources. The **Warden** can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area.  |

### Cardinal Directions
Roll **1d6** to determine how many miles off-route the characters are, then roll **1d8** and consult the following table to find out the direction they traveled. 

|         |                | 
| :-----: | :-----------:  | 
| **d8**  | **Direction**  |
