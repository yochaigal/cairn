# Wilderness Exploration

## The Basics
- A day is divided in 3 phases of 8 hours each (morning, noon, night).
- A single **Wilderness Action** can be chosen per phase. 
- For each night the party skips the **Rest** action, each PC adds one **Fatigue** to their inventory.
- At the start of each day, roll on the [**Weather**](#weather) table for the appropriate season.
- For hexcrawls, a hex represents 6 miles on the map. 

### Wilderness Actions
#### Travel
- The party travels 6 miles (or across a single hex). Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby hexes are revealed according to their distance.
- A healthy person can walk up to 24 miles per day (or two hexes). Horses and other mounts increase travel speed.
- Difficult terrain, obstacles, and slower party members can reduce travel speed by half or more.
- The party must be careful to avoid losing their way (see [Getting Lost](#getting-lost).
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).

##### Getting Lost
- There is a 2-in-6 chance the party will get lost when traveling via difficult terrain.
- If the party gets lost, they may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. Optionally roll on the [Cardinal Directions](#cardinal-directions) table to see where the party finds themselves.
- Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances of getting lost to 1-in-6.

##### Cardinal Directions
When required, consult the following table to determine a cardinal direction.

|      |           |
| :--: | :-------: |
|  d8  | Direction |
|  1   |     N     |
|  2   |    NW     |
|  3   |     W     |
|  4   |    SW     |
|  5   |     S     |
|  6   |    SE     |
|  7   |     E     |
|  8   |    NE     |


#### Explore
The party searches for hidden any features within the current hex.
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- One Location/Feature is discovered.

#### Supply
The party gathers food and water.
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- Hunt, fish, or forage for food. Each person involved has a 3-in-6 chance of collecting 1d4 rations worth. Characters with relevant experience can increase the chances of success or negate the roll entirely. 

#### Rest
The party stops to set up camp.
- The Warden rolls on the [Events Table](#events-table).
- If the party is able to rest fully, each party members loses all their **Fatigue** (if applicable).

## Events Table 
The GM rolls a **d6** and consults the table appropriate to the party’s location.

|                         |                  |             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
|  **1** |  **Encounter** | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [reactions](#/cairn-srd/#reactions) if applicable. |
|  **2** | **Sign**  | The characters discover a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area/hex.   |
|  **3** | **Locality**  | A shift in weather, terrain.   |
|  **4** | **Expiration**  | Resources are drained in some way (lost ration or broken tools).   |
|  **5** | **Exhaustion** |  The characters encounter a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional **Wilderness Action**) or adding **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties.
|  **6** | **Discovery** | The characters find food, treasure, or other useful resources. The Warden can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area/hex.  |
