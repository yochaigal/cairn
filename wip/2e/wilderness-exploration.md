## Watches

- A day is divided into three **watches**, called _morning_, _afternoon_, and _night_. 
- Each character can choose _one_ [**Wilderness Action**](#wilderness-actions) per **watch**. 
- If the characters split up, each group is treated as an independent entity.

> ### Weather
> Each day, the **Warden** rolls on the [**Weather**](#weather-difficulty) table for the appropriate season.

## Points

- Potential destinations on a map are called **points**. 
- One or more **watches** may be required to journey between two **points** on a map, depending on the travel **Difficulty**.
- The party has a rough idea of the challenges involved to get to their destination, but rarely any specifics. 

> ### Hexes
> When using a hex map, assume that the **Travel** action moves the party to an adjacent tile in one **watch** at _Normal_ **travel speed**, and that if they [**get lost**](#getting-lost), the party ends up in a random adjacent hex.

## Wilderness Exploration Cycle

1. The **Warden** describes the current **point** or **region** on the map, and how the current [**Difficulty**](#difficulty) affects the party's **travel speed**. The party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination. 
2. Each party member chooses a single **Wilderness Action**. The **Warden** narrates the results for each, and then rolls on the [**Wilderness Events**](#wilderness-events) table. The party responds to the results.
3. The **players** and the **Warden** record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, _deprivation_, etc), and the cycle repeats. 

## Night

- The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far slower and more treacherous!
- Traveling at night _always_ increases the **Difficulty** by one step (i.e. **Easy** terrain becomes **Tough**), and the **Warden** rolls twice on the [**Wilderness Events**](#wilderness-events) table.
- Some terrain and weather may be easier to traverse at night (desert, for example). The **Warden** should balance these challenges along with any other.

### Sleep

- The last **watch** of the day is typically reserved for the [**Make Camp**](#make-camp) action.
- Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.
- If the party skips the **Make Camp** action, they each add one **Fatigue** to their inventory, and are _deprived_. Additionally, a sleep-deprived party raises the **Difficulty** of a terrain by one step (i.e. **Easy** becomes **Tough**).

### Light

- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft ahead of the party, but beyond that only provides a dim outline of objects.
- Characters without a light source may suffer from _panic_ until their situation is remedied. 
- Environmental conditions (sudden gusts of wind, dust, water, etc.) can easily blow out a torch.

> ### Light Sources
> A torch can be lit 3 times before degrading. A lantern can be relit indefinitely, but requires an oil can (6 uses).

## Difficulty

- An area's [**weather**](#weather-difficulty), [**terrain**](#terrain-difficulty), obstacles, [**night travel**](#night), and _deprived_ or injured party members can reduce the party's speed or make travel impossible. 
- Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or even overcome a terrain's **Difficulty**. The party may also need to spend **Fatigue**, resources, tools or other resource in order to sustain their pace.  
- Maintained roads and trails should be considered **Easy** unless the terrain or weather say otherwise.

### Terrain Difficulty

## Wilderness Actions

### Travel

- Travel begins. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance. This action is typically taken by the entire party as one.
- The party rolls **1d6** to see if they get lost along the way. This risk can increase or decrease, depending on the travel **Difficulty**, items, skills, and relevant backgrounds of the party.
- If lost, the party may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. Otherwise, the party reaches the next **point** along their route. Remember to compare the results of getting lost to the current travel **Difficulty**. For example, **Tough** terrain in Fair weather would require a roll of 2 or under in order for the party to get lost.  

### Explore

- One or more party members search a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.
- A Location (shelter, village, cave, etc.) or Feature (geyser, underground river, beached ship, etc.) is discovered.
- The **Travel** action is still required to _leave_ the current area, even if it has been completely explored.

### Supply

- Characters can hunt, fish, or forage for food, collecting d4 **Rations** (3 uses each). 
- For each additional participant the chance for a higher yield increases  (e.g. d4 becomes d6, and so on.). Relevant experience or equipment can also increase the bounty. 
- The party may encounter homes and small villages, spending gold and a full **watch** to resupply. 

### Make Camp

- The party stops to set up camp in the wilds. Each party member (and their mounts) consume a **Ration**.
- A **lookout rotation** is set so that the party can sleep unmolested. At least 3 rotations are necessary to ensure that all party members can rest. A smaller party may need to risk sleeping unguarded, or switch off sleeping over multiple days (see [**Sleep**](#sleep)).
- Party members that were able to rest remove all of **Fatigue** from their inventory.

## Tables

### Weather
If the "**Extreme**" weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to "**Catastrophic**". A squall becomes a hurricane, a storm floods the valley, etc.

| ----- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Encounter**   | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [reactions](/cairn-srd/#reactions) if applicable.                                                                               |
| **2** | **Sign**        | The party discovers a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area.                                                                                      |
| **3** | **Environment** | A shift in weather or terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **4** | **Loss**        | The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort.                                                                                                                        |
| **5** | **Exhaustion**  | The party encounters a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional **Wilderness Action**) or adding **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties. |
| **6** | **Discovery**   | The party finds food, treasure, or other useful resources. The **Warden** can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area.                                                                                    |

## Example
In this example we'll be using a map made with [Watabou's](https://watabou.itch.io/) terrific [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) generator.

[![Alt text](/img/2e/wilderness-map.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/wilderness-map.png)

A party of 3 PCs (**Leib**, **Konstin**, and **Gar**) are plotting a journey to an ancient ruin deep in the forests of **Ein Eyton**. They plan to walk by foot. 
The forest (at **3**) is separated from the party's present location (the village of **Rudbat**, at **1**) by the neighboring **Range of Deshe** (at **2**), a short distance away. 

The **Warden** explains that travelling on the forgiving roads from the village to the hills will require only a single **watch**, but that it will take three _additional_ **watches** for the party to complete their journey to the forest, assuming they spend one **watch** sleeping. 

The party accepts this route, plotting their route: one **watch** to reach the hills (_morning_), one **watch** partway through the hills (_afternoonh_), then another **watch** sleeping (the **Making Camp** action) at (_night_). The party would spend the following day's _morning_ **watch** travelling to their final destination. On the first day of travel, the **Warden** rolls a 3 on the **Weather** table (**Fall**: _Cool and foggy_). 

For their first **watch**, the party chooses the **Travel** action, taking the road through the farmlands and to the hills. The terrain, weather, and current party status indicates that the **Difficulty** level is **Easy**. The party is able to travel with no forseeable problems, so the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is an **Encounter**. The **Warden** explains that the party crosses paths with an NPC travelling South, who gives them a piece of advice: "_Avoid the hills, there are bandits about_!" The party notes this and moves on, arriving in the **Range of Deshe** after lunchtime. They rest near a streambed, stepping off the dusty road for the first time.

For the party's second **watch**, the **Warden** explains that this area is peppered with small rocks and uneven hills, setting the terrain **Difficulty** to **Tough**. Worse yet, without a guide the party might easily lose their way! The players discuss whether it would be better to spend a **watch** exploring the area, perhaps even finding a faster (and safer) way through. 

The party agrees that arriving at their destination sooner is worth the risk, and proceeds with the **Travel** action again. The players discuss how to avoid **Getting Lost**, checking to see if anyone in the party has knowledge of the area, relevant experience, or a map. They do not, so the **Warden** rolls a d6. The result is not a **1** or a **2**, and the party moves on as planned.

The **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table, and the result is **Environment**. The **Warden** explains that a short while after entering the hills, the ground became much more demanding to cross. Small rocks turned into large crags, the hills to pits and mini-craters. The party now has a choice: push forward, spending a **Fatigue** to keep their current speed, or slow down, adding an additional **watch** of travel to their journey. They agree to push forward, each character adding a **Fatigue** to their inventory. Had they chosen to walk slower it may have been safer, but they would have an additional half-day of walking to do tomorrow.

As night descends, the party finds a large, rocky, outcropping that would work as a suitable shelter. There is no water nearby, but this location should be sufficient for their current needs. They agree to **Make Camp** as their final **watch**, choosing a **Watch Rotation** that should allow all party members a decent rest, and a chance to shed any **Fatigue** they have. Each party member consumes a ration, and the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is a **Sign**. The **Warden** describes the flickering ghost of a torchlight in the distance. Could it be another party, or perhaps bandits, or even a dangerous creature on the prowl?

The party rests, erasing their **Fatigue**. They mark their current location on the map, noting that should everything go well the following day, they should only have to spend one **watch** to arrive at the ruins of **Ein Eyton** by the _afternoon_.
