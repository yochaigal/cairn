# Wilderness Exploration

## Watches
- A day is divided into three **watches**, called _morning_, _afternoon_, and _night_. 
- Each character can choose _one_ [**Wilderness Action**](#wilderness-actions) per **watch**. 
- If the characters split up, each group is treated as an independent entity.

> ### Weather
> Each day, the **Warden** rolls on the [**Weather**](#weather) table for the appropriate season.

## Points
- Potential destinations on a map are called **points**. 
- One or more **watches** may be required to journey between two **points** on a map, depending on the travel **Difficulty**.
- A party walking on roads or settled terrain can usually travel between two nearby **points** in a single **watch**.

> ### Hexes
> If using hexes, assume that the **Travel** action moves the party to an adjacent tile in one **watch** at _Normal_ **travel speed**, and that if they [**get lost**](#getting-lost) the party ends up in an adjacent hex.

## Wilderness Exploration Cycle
1. The **Warden** describes the current **point**, **area** or **region** on the map.
2. The **Warden** explains how the current [**Difficulty**](#difficulty) affects the party's **travel speed**.
3. The party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination, each character choosing a single **Wilderness Action**.
4. The **Warden** narrates the results, and then rolls on the [**Wilderness Events**](#wilderness-events) table. The party responds to the results.
5. The **players** and the **Warden** record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, _deprivation_, etc). 
6. The process is repeated, starting from step **1**. 

## Night
- The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far slower and more treacherous!
- Travelling at night _always_ increases the difficulty by one step (i.e. **Easy** terrain becomes **Tough**), and the **Warden** rolls twice on the [**Wilderness Events**](#wilderness-events) table.
- Some terrain and weather may be easier to traverse at night (desert, for example). The **Warden** should balance these challenges along with any other.

### Sleep
- The last **watch** of the day is typically reserved for the [**Make Camp**](#make-camp) action.
- Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.
- If the party skips the **Make Camp** action, they each add one **Fatigue** to their inventory, and are _deprived_. Additionally, a sleep-deprived party raises the difficulty of a terrain by one step (i.e. **Easy** becomes **Tough**), even during the day.


### Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft ahead of the party, but beyond that only provides a dim outline of objects.
- A torch can be lit 3 times before degrading. A lantern can be relit 6 times per oil can, but requires more inventory slots.
- Characters without a light source may suffer from _panic_ until their situation is remedied. 

### Panic
- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience _panic_. A **WIL** **save** is required to avoid losing control and becoming _panicked_. 
- As an **action**, a _panicked_ character can make a **WIL** **save** to overcome the _panic_ condition. 
- A _panicked_ character has 0 **HP**, is always _surprised_, and all of their attacks are _impaired_.  

## Difficulty
- An area's [**weather**](#weather-difficulty), [**terrain**](#terrain-difficulty), obstacles, [**night travel**](#night), and slow or injured party members can reduce travel speed or make travel impossible. 
- The party may need to spend **Fatigue**, resources, tools or other resource in order to maintain their travel speed. 
- Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or even overcome a terrain's difficulty.

### Terrain Difficulty

| **Catastrophic** | Most parties cannot travel under these conditions.     | _Tornados, tidal waves, hurricane, etc._ |

## Wilderness Actions
### Travel
- Travel begins. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance. 
- If necessary, the party rolls **1d6** to see if they've become lost.
- Provided they don't [**get lost**](#getting-lost), the party reaches the next **point** along their route. 

#### Getting Lost
- If lost, the party may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. 
- Maps and relevant backgrounds may negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances of getting lost.

### Explore
- The party covers a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.
- One Location or Feature is discovered.
- The **Travel** action is still required to _leave_ the current area, even if it has been completely explored.

### Supply
- The party gathers food and water.
- Characters can hunt, fish, or forage for food, each participant collecting 1d4 rations worth. 
- A character with relevant foraging, hunting, or fishing experience increases the supplies **they** discover by one or two steps (i.e. 1d6 or 1d8).

### Make Camp
- The party stops to set up camp in the wilds. Each party member (and their mounts) consume a ration.
- A **lookout rotation** is set so that the party can sleep unmolested. At least 3 rotations are necessary to ensure that all party members can rest. A smaller party may need to risk sleeping unguarded, or switch off sleeping over multiple days (see [**Sleep**](#sleep)).
- Party members that were able to rest remove all of **Fatigue** from their inventory.
 
## Tables

### Weather
If the "**Extreme**" weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to "**Catastrophic**". A summer squall becomes a hurricane, a fall storm floods the valleys, etc.

| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
|  **1** |  **Encounter** | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for NPC [reactions](/cairn-srd/#reactions) if applicable. |
|  **2** | **Sign**  | The party discover a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area.   |
|  **3** | **Environment**  | A shift in weather or terrain.   |
|  **4** | **Loss**  | The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort. |
|  **5** | **Exhaustion** | The party encounter a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional **Wilderness Action**) or adding **Fatigue** to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties.
|  **6** | **Discovery** | The party find food, treasure, or other useful resources. The **Warden** can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area.  |

## Example
In this example we'll be using a map made with [Watabou's](https://watabou.itch.io/) terrific [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) generator.

[![Alt text](/img/2e/wilderness-map.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/wilderness-map.png)

A party of 3 PCs (**Leib**, **Konstin**, and **Gar**) are plotting a journey to an ancient ruin deep in the forests of **Ein Eyton**. They plan to walk by foot. 
The forest (at **3**) is separated from the party's present location (the village of **Rudbat**, at **1**) by the neighboring **Range of Deshe** (at **2**), a short distance away. 

The **Warden** explains that travelling on the forgiving roads from the village to the hills will require only a single **watch**, but that it will take three _additional_ **watches** for the party to complete their journey to the forest, assuming they spend one **watch** sleeping. 

The party accepts this route, plotting their route: one **watch** to reach the hills (_dawn_), one **watch** partway through the hills (_midday_), then another **watch** sleeping (the **Making Camp** action) at (_dusk_). The party would spend the following day's _dawn_ **watch** travelling to their final destination. On the first day of travel, the **Warden** rolls a 3 on the **Weather** table (**Fall**: _Cool and foggy_). 

For their first **watch**, the party chooses the **Travel** action, taking the road through the farmlands and to the hills. The terrain, weather, and current party status indicates that the **Difficulty** level is **Easy**. The party is able to travel with no forseeable problems, so the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is an **Encounter**. The **Warden** explains that the party crosses paths with an NPC travelling South, who gives them a piece of advice: "_Avoid the hills, there are bandits about_!" The party notes this and moves on, arriving in the **Range of Deshe** after lunchtime. They rest near a streambed, stepping off the dusty road for the first time.

For the party's second **watch**, the **Warden** explains that this area is peppered with small rocks and uneven hills, setting the terrain **Difficulty** to **Tough**. Worse yet, without a guide the party might easily lose their way! The players discuss whether it would be better to spend a **watch** exploring the area, perhaps even finding a faster (and safer) way through. 

The party agrees that arriving at their destination sooner is worth the risk, and proceeds with the **Travel** action again. The players discuss how to avoid **Getting Lost**, checking to see if anyone in the party has knowledge of the area, relevant experience, or a map. They do not, so the **Warden** rolls 1d6. The result is not a **1** or a **2**, and the party moves on as planned.

The **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table, and the result is **Environment**. The **Warden** explains that a short while after entering the hills, the ground became much more demanding to cross. Small rocks turned into large crags, the hills to pits and mini-craters. The party now has a choice: push forward, spending a **Fatigue** to keep their current speed, or slow down, adding an additional **watch** of travel to their journey. They agree to push forward, each character adding a **Fatigue** to their inventory. Had they chosen to walk slower it may have been safer, but they would have an additional half-day of walking to do tomorrow.

As night descends, the party finds a large, rocky, outcropping that would work as a suitable shelter. There is no water nearby, but this location should be sufficient for their current needs. They agree to **Make Camp** as their final **watch**, choosing a **Watch Rotation** that should allow all party members a decent rest, and a chance to shed any **Fatigue** they have. Each party member consumes a ration, and the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is a **Sign**. The **Warden** describes the flickering ghost of a torchlight in the distance. Could it be another party, or perhaps bandits, or even a dangerous creature on the prowl?

The party rests, erasing their **Fatigue**. They mark their current location on the map, noting that should everything go well the following day, they should only have to spend one **watch** to arrive at the ruins of **Ein Eyton** before _midday_.
