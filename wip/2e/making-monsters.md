# Making Monsters

## Create a Monster

To create a unique monster, follow these steps:
- Roll on the [Monster Appearance](#monster-appearance) table.
- Roll on the [Monster Abilities](#monster-abilities) table.
- Roll on the [Monster Attacks](#monster-attacks) table.
- Describe the creature's appearance, abilities, and attacks in plain English.
- Create the creature's stats according to the principles, definitions, and stat block format below.

### Principles

- Use **Critical Damage** to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Use flavor and style to help creatures stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Always adjust creature stats based on what is fun and interesting.

#### **Hit Protection**

A creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill. Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardier ones 6 HP, and serious threats should get 10 HP or higher.

#### Armor

For some creatures this represents their natural toughness, for others it may be from something that is worn or carried. If a creature is able to withstand an attack without moving, raise this number. 

#### Ability Score

3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. 

#### Strength

Tracks overall health, physical power, and resistance to poisons. It is the ability of a creature to survive a direct hit, not its ability to avoid danger! 

#### Dexterity

Start with **10** as a base, and if the creature is particularly quick, agile, or nimble increase the number as necessary. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number.

#### Willpower

Determines a creature's ability to withstand the influence of another, as well as their power over others. It also acts as a measurement of their defense in magical or spiritual matters.

#### Attacks

Typically an object (e.g. a sword or bow) or a natural weapon (claws or teeth).

#### Abilities

A unique action or power the creature can utilize both in and out of combat.     

##### Considerations:
- If an ability can be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Attack and interacts with HP.
- If an ability cannot be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Ability.
- If an ability only affects a single PC it should generally have an immediate effect with no chance to Save in that round (possibly not at all).
- If an ability is capable of affecting a group of PCs it should generally call for an immediate Save.

### Monster Stat Block Format

X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Attack (dX, special items, _qualities_)
- An engaging descriptor of appearance, demeanor, or living habits.
- A quirk, tactic, or peculiarity that distinguish this creature.
- Special effect or consequence of critical damage.

## Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems. Here are some tips that might help with the process!

- **Hit Protection**: A good rule of thumb is to give the creature +1 HP for every **HD**, on top of a minimum **3 HP** (the average person). I usually think of **HD** as equivalent to a d6, which has a _mean_ of 3.5. Always start with a creature's **HP** _first_, _then_ do their **STR**.
- **Armor**: Look for phrases like "as leather" and "as plate" in the original stat blocks. When converting from B/X style games like Old School Essentials, ignore THAC0 and use descending AC whenever possible (7 = Leather, 5 = Chainmail, 3 = Plate mail). If only ascending AC is given you can use (12 = Leather, 14 = Chainmail, 16 = Plate mail). Whichever system you're converting from, the Armor values range from 1-3 only.
- **Strength**: Look at the creature's **HD** and **HP**. If a creature is difficult to kill but _not_ because they are nimble or skilled, give them more **STR** (but _not_ more **HP**). Start with 10 **STR** (the average) and go up or down from there.
- **Dexterity**: Start with **10** as a base, and if the creature is particularly quick (often referred to as "speed" or SP), agile, or nimble-fingered, raise the number. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number. See [Saving Throws](#saving-throws) below for more!
- **Willpower**: **Morale** (**ML**) can be a good guidepost, and typically ranges between 2-12. The greater the creature's personality, spirit, or presence, the higher the WIL they should have. The following table offers a decent guide on converting **ML** to **WIL**.

|         |   |    |    |    |
|---------|---|----|----|----|
| **ML**  | 4 | 8  | 10 | 12 |
| **WIL** | 6 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

### Combat

- **Damage**: Can typically be copied as is from most OSR systems, but it's a good idea to check with the weapon's listed in the Marketplace.
- **Multiple attacks**: Can convert to _Blast_ and/or the "two weapons" rule (e.g. d6+d6 is roll 2d6, keep highest).
- **When in doubt**: Think about how much serious damage the creature is supposed to do. Remember that instead of raising attack damage a step, think about making it _enhanced_ in certain situations, or just use the _Blast_ and "two weapons" rule.

### Abilities

- Sometimes the mechanics of the original system simply _do not translate_. That's OK; try to take what's cool about the creature and write a "version" of their ability more appropriate to Cairn.
- If the monster has an attack that asks the PCs to attempt to dodge or save against some ability, consider making the ability an out-of-combat "trap" that the PCs can trigger. Otherwise _make it succeed automatically_ during combat. The Warden can always telegraph the danger prior to combat to better prepare the PCs against the danger.
- Abilities can sometimes be made into weapons, and assign a damage die, making Critical Damage reveal the damage. More often you should simply let the ability or attack _happen_. Combat is dangerous, and it is up to the Warden to properly telegraph danger before the fighting begins.

### Magic

- Magical creatures can just "know" a bunch of spells. In this case, make their corpses magical (and dangerous)!
- Spells are tricky; you can give magic-users Spellbooks, but remember, they might _drop_ them when defeated.
- I like to make 1d4 dropped Spellbooks implode ([Die of Fate](/cairn-srd#die-of-fate)), just to mix it up!

### Saving Throws

- You can rely on _saving throws_ to glean more information about a creature's abilities, specifically their ability to avoid death by physical trauma, magic, or poison. 
- Stat blocks will use a shorthand like (E1) or (F1) (Level 1 Elf or Fighter respectively). These are really helpful for quickly identifying at the creature's abilities.
- Consider adding descriptive tags such as "immune to toxic gas" or "good at dodging bullets" based on the saving throws. The following table should help determine which saving throws should result in an increase in one of the relevant ability scores.

|                                |                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Death or Poison**            | **STR**            |
| **Wands**                      | **DEX**            |
| **Paralysis or Petrification** | **WIL** or **STR** |
| **Breath Attacks**             | **DEX** or **STR** |
| **Spells, Rods or Staves**     | **WIL**            |

## Use The Fiction

Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

Take for example this creature:

#### Foxwoman

Can take the form of a fox, a woman, or a 7' tall fox-headed.  
_HD 5, Speed 120', Armor 14, Morale 11, Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)_
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_**Using the example above, I can see that she:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Looking at the stats, it seems like she doesn't have too high HP, and she's quite fast.
- Her **ML** is pretty high. She's obviously quite willful.
- Agile and lithe.
- Attacks with deadly teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to metal weapons.

_**What can we learn from this?**_  
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. Starting from **3 HP**, then counting 1 **HP** per additional **HD** is **8 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. Normal human is 10 and she's bigger. **12 STR**.
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**.
- Her **ML** is high but not the max. And foxes are pretty cunning, right? She'll stick it out in a tough situation. **15 WIL**.
- I'd go with **bite (d6)** for the teeth attack, and **claws (d8+d8)**, the same as any two-handed weapon.

_**In summary, that leaves us with the following opening stat block:**_  
_8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)_

_**Now on to her abilities:**_  
This is pretty straightforward. We simply read the fictional stat block we created earlier!
- We know what she looks like, and that she can transform into a fox at will.
- She cannot be harmed by metal; I'm taking this to mean she's immune to _metal weapons_.
- She chokes her victims.

_**Easy, right? Now to make it useful:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on soon after.

_**And that's it!**_
_**Behold, a converted Cairn monster:**_

#### Foxwoman

8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, claws or hands (d8+d8)

- Can take the form of a fox, or a woman with a single, hidden fox led.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- **Critical damage**: Victim is choked unconscious.
