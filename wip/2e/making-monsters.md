### Monster Stat Block Format

X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Attack (dX, special items, _qualities_)
- An engaging descriptor of appearance, demeanor, or living habits.
- A quirk, tactic, or peculiarity that distinguish this creature.
- Special effect or consequence of critical damage.

### Definitions

- **Hit Protection** is a creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill. Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardier ones 6 HP, and serious threats should get 10 HP or higher.
- **Armor**: For some creatures this represents their natural toughness, for others it may be from something that is worn or carried. If a creature is able to withstand an attack without moving, raise this number. 
- **Ability Scores**: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.
- **Strength**: Tracks overall health, physical power, and resistance to poisons. It is the ability of a creature to survive a direct hit, not its ability to avoid danger! 
- **Dexterity**: Start with **10** as a base, and if the creature is particularly quick, agile, or nimble increase the number as necessary. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number.
- **Willpower**: Determines a creature's ability to withstand the influence of another, as well as their power over others. It also acts as a measurement of their defense in magical or spiritual matters.
- **Attacks**:
- **Abilities**:   

## Principles

- If an action can be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Attack and interacts with HP.
- If an action cannot be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Ability.
- If an Ability only affects a single PC it should generally have an immediate effect with no chance to Save in that round (possibly not at all).
- If an Ability is capable of affecting a group of PCs it should generally call for an immediate Save.
- Adjust based on what is fun and interesting.
- Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Use **Critical Damage** to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.

## Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems.  
Below are some tips that might help with the process!

## The Basics

Review the instructions in the [SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#creating-monsters). A couple of things to keep in mind:
- OSE (or B/X) has really great stat blocks that can be easily truncated for quick conversion. See this [page](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/General) and this [PDF](https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-adaptation-guidelines) for more.
- Dungeon World has some great monster "moves" that translate to Critical Damage quite nicely, so looking for an equivalent creature in that system can really help! See this example [here](http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/5698559156420608).
- Sometimes a direct stat to stat translation isn't an option. That's OK! There is a [way](/resources/tools/converting-monsters/#use-the-fiction)!

### Health, Armor & Abilities

- **Hit Protection** is _not_ health. It's the creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill. If the PCs will have a tough time landing a blow that actually causes damage, the creature has high **HP**. A good rule of thumb is to give the creature +1 HP for every **HD**, on top of a minimum **3 HP** (the average person). I usually think of **HD** as equivalent to a d6, which has a _mean_ of 3.5. Always start with a creature's **HP** _first_, _then_ do their **STR**.
- **Armor** is generally easy to map; phrases like "as leather" and "as plate" are really helpful. Generally ignore THAC0 and use descending AC (7 = Leather, 5 = Chainmail, 3 = Plate mail). If only ascending AC is given you can use (12 = Leather, 14 = Chainmail, 16 = Plate mail). Whichever system you're converting from, the Armor values range from 1-3.
- **Strength** is both health and physical power.  It also tracks constitution & resistance to poisons.  Look at the creature's **HD** and **HP** (even if you've already done so for **Hit Protection**). **STR** is the ability of a creature to survive a direct hit, not its ability to avoid danger! If a creature is difficult to kill but _not_ because they are good avoiding injury, give them more **STR** (_not_ more **HP**). A good rule of thumb is to compare them to the average person (10 **STR**) and go up or down from there.
- **Dexterity** is probably the easiest of the bunch. Start with **10** as a base and if the creature is particularly quick (sometimes called speed or SP), agile or nimble-fingered make it go up. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number. See [Saving Throws](#saving-throws) below for more tricks!
- **Willpower** is tricky. It rarely comes up but when it does, it's nice to have. High **WIL** is strong personality, spirit or presence. **Morale** (**ML**) can be a good guidepost for **Willpower** as well. Morale typically ranges between 2-12; some games use a "Morale Check" is used to determine if a monster flees (in Cairn a **WIL** save is used instead). The referee rolls 2d6; if the result is higher than the monster's **ML** score, they flee.  

The following table offers a decent guide on converting **ML** to **WIL**.

|         |   |    |    |    |
|---------|---|----|----|----|
| **ML**  | 4 | 8  | 10 | 12 |
| **WIL** | 6 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

### Combat

- Attack **damage** is pretty straightforward coming from games like OSE (or B / X); you can usually just copy them as-is. Double-check with the [weapons table](/cairn-srd/#weapons) if unsure.
- Multiple attacks (e.g. 2 x claw, 1 x sting) typically convert to [_Blast_](/cairn-srd#Blast) and/or the "two weapons" rule (e.g. d6+d6 is roll 2d6, keep highest).
- When in doubt, think about how much serious damage the creature is supposed to do. Remember that instead of raising attack damage a step, think about making it _enhanced_ in certain situations or use the _Blast_ and "two weapons" rule.

### Abilities & Magic

- Sometimes the mechanics of the original system simply _do not translate_. That's OK; try to take what's cool about the creature and write a "version" of their ability more appropriate to Cairn.
- If the monster has an attack that asks the PCs to attempt to dodge or save against some ability, consider making the ability an out-of-combat "trap" that the PCs can trigger. Otherwise _make it succeed automatically_ during combat. The Warden can always telegraph the danger prior to combat to better prepare the PCs against the danger.
- Abilities can sometimes be made into weapons, and assign a damage die, making Critical Damage reveal the damage. More often you should simply let the ability or attack _happen_. Combat is dangerous, and it is up to the Warden to properly telegraph danger before the fighting begins.

### Magic

- Magical creatures can just "know" a bunch of spells. In this case, make their corpses magical (and dangerous)!
- Spells are tricky; you can give magic-users Spellbooks but remember, they might _drop_ them when defeated.
- I like to make 1d4 dropped Spellbooks implode ([Die of Fate](/cairn-srd#die-of-fate)), just to mix it up!

### Saving Throws

- You can rely on _saving throws_ to glean more information about a creature's abilities, specifically their ability to avoid death by physical trauma, magic, or poison. See the [OSE SRD](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Checks,_Damage,_Saves) for more details.
- Occasionally stat blocks will use a shorthand like (E1) or (F1) (Level 1 [Elf](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Elf) or [Fighter](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Fighter) respectively). These are really helpful for quickly identifying at the creature's abilities.
- Consider adding descriptive tags such as "immune to toxic gas" or "good at dodging bullets" based on the saving throws.

The following table should help determine which saving throws should result in an increase in one of the relevant ability scores.

|                                |            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Death or Poison**            | STR        |
| **Wands**                      | DEX        |
| **Paralysis or Petrification** | WIL or STR |
| **Breath Attacks**             | DEX or STR |
| **Spells, Rods or Staves**     | WIL        |

### Stat Block Structure

 There are many ways to do this, but try to be consistent! In Cairn I write it like this:
**Name**
X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, _qualities_), special items
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
- Special effect or critical damage consequence

## Use The Fiction

Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

Take for example this creature:

#### Foxwoman

Can take the form of a fox, a woman, or a 7' tall fox-headed.  
_HD 5, Speed 120', Armor 14, Morale 11, Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)_
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_**Using the example above, I can see that she:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Looking at the stats, it seems like she doesn't have too high HP, and she's quite fast.
- Her **ML** is pretty high. She's obviously quite willful.
- Agile and lithe.
- Attacks with deadly teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to metal weapons.

_**What can we learn from this?**_  
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. Starting from **3 HP**, then counting 1 **HP** per additional **HD** is **8 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. Normal human is 10 and she's bigger. **12 STR**.
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**.
- Her **ML** is high but not the max. And foxes are pretty cunning, right? She'll stick it out in a tough situation. **15 WIL**.
- I'd go with **bite (d6)** for the teeth attack, and **claws (d8+d8)**, the same as any two-handed weapon.

_**In summary, that leaves us with the following opening stat block:**_  
_8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)_

_**Now on to her abilities:**_  
This is pretty straightforward. We simply read the fictional stat block we created earlier!
- We know what she looks like, and that she can transform into a fox at will.
- She cannot be harmed by metal; I'm taking this to mean she's immune to _metal weapons_.
- She chokes her victims.

_**Easy, right? Now to make it useful:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on soon after.

_**And that's it!**_
_**Behold, a converted Cairn monster:**_

#### Foxwoman

8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, claws or hands (d8+d8)

- Can take the form of a fox, or a woman with a single, hidden fox led.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- **Critical damage**: Victim is choked unconscious.
