|      |                                                              |

| 1    | Your family has a long tradition of tunnel rangers, and you were trained from a young age. You carry a well-worn heirloom compass that has guided generations of your kin. |
| 2    | After an accidental cave-in trapped you underground for several days, you taught yourself how to navigate the treacherous tunnels. You still have a small, lucky stone from that harrowing experience. |
| 3    | A mysterious mentor took you under their wing and taught you the secrets of the underground world. They disappeared one day, leaving behind only a cryptic message etched into a stalagmite. |
| 4    | You stumbled upon a hidden underground city while searching for a lost treasure. You managed to escape with a rare artifact, a key to a forgotten vault hidden somewhere in the depths. |
| 5    | You once served as a scout for a subterranean expedition that ended in disaster. You were the only survivor, and you've since dedicated your life to mastering the world beneath the surface. You possess a tattered expedition flag as a reminder. |
| 6    | You discovered a natural underground spring with miraculous healing properties. You've been exploring the depths ever since, seeking other hidden wonders. You carry a vial of the spring's water with you at all times. |

## What unique item from the depths do you carry with you? Roll 1d6:

|      |                        |                                                              |

| 1    | **Glowing Fungus**     | A jar of bioluminescent fungi that emit a soft, eerie light. Useful for illuminating dark tunnels without alerting potential threats. |
| 2    | **Cave Fisher's Hook** | A sturdy, barbed grappling hook made from the exoskeleton of a cave fisher, a fearsome subterranean predator. Useful for scaling walls or trapping foes. |
| 3    | **Crystal Geode**      | A hollow, unassuming stone that, when cracked open, reveals a dazzling array of colorful crystals. Can be used to barter with subterranean dwellers or as a light source in a pinch. |
| 4    | **Echo Pebble**        | A smooth stone that, when thrown, emits a series of echoes that reveal the layout of the surrounding area. Useful for mapping uncharted tunnels and detecting hidden passages. |
| 5    | **Gloom Moth Wing**    | A delicate, translucent wing from a rare, elusive Gloom Moth. When crushed into a fine powder and applied to the eyes, it grants temporary darkvision. |
| 6    | **Stalactite Whistle** | A small, hollowed-out stalactite that produces an ultrasonic frequency when blown. Can be used to communicate with or control certain subterranean creatures. |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....

The **Order of the Umbral Depths**, a secretive organization that protects and studies the ancient secrets hidden beneath the surface. They demand that you recover a powerful artifact from a long-forgotten underground temple as repayment for knowledge they've shared with you. Until the debt is paid, their agents will doggedly pursue you, always lurking in the shadows.
