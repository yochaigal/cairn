## Why did you leave The Woods behind? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | An ill-tempered spirit cursed you for stealing its heart-seed. Now any plant you touch wilts and dies. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. Ingesting it cures any poison (one use, unless retrieved). |
| **2** | Grief over a friend's death follows you, their face appearing in any any tea you brew. Take a soporific concoction.                                                                        |
| **3** | An accidental poisoning cost you your sense of taste and smell, but you can now withstand noxious fumes. Take a book on dangerous plants.                                                  |
| **4** | Your radical experiments altered you; you now subsist only on sun and water. Instead of rations, you carry a fortified jug of water (bulky).                                               |
| **5** | Your impressive corpseflower won a contest in **The Cobbles**, then promptly killed a judge. You fled, but not without the prize money (100gp).                                            |
| **6** | A restorative tincture you brewed caused infertility in a patient. Take a healing potion that completely restores STR. Only you know of its unintended side-effects                        |

## What keepsake accompanies you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                  |                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Amadou**       | A peculiar kind of fungus that catches flame quite easily. Six uses.                                 |
| **2** | **Delphinium**   | An elixir allowing the drinker to hold their breath for an hour, can be divided into multiple doses. |
| **3** | **Tacky Stalk**  | A woody reed that, when chewed, hardens into a permanent adhesive.                                   |
| **4** | **Wisp Lantern** |  **Wisp Lantern** | Caged in wrought iron, providing an unending light that grows stronger as the wisp feeds on nearby pain and fear. |
| **5** | **Seed Bomb**    | Three dirt clods in canvas sacks that explode on impact, scattering seeds. d6 damage (_blast).       |
| **6** | **Briarvine**    | Entangles any creature smaller than an elephant. One use.                                            |

## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is in Debt to....

The **Wooded Dead**, a group of benign Forest Liches. After trespassing on a sacred grove, they demand you plant a grove of rare (and expensive) **Corpsewood** trees, whose saplings grow wherever the dead rest in great numbers. Until your debt is paid, travelling through **The Woods** is slower, and forest critters shy away from you.
