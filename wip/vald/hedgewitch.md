|      |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Your village was plagued by a mysterious illness, and you dedicated yourself to finding a cure. After years of research and experimentation, you discovered the right combination of herbs and techniques to heal the afflicted. Start with a book of herbal remedies and a reputation for healing in your village. |
| 2    | You were born with a natural affinity for the healing arts and could sense the curative properties of plants from a young age. An elderly hedgewitch took you under their wing and taught you their secrets. Start with a charm of protection made by your mentor and a collection of rare herbs. |
| 3    | In a moment of desperation, you made a pact with a woodland spirit to gain the power to heal a loved one. The spirit granted your request, but in return, you were bound to serve as a healer for others in need. Start with a small, enchanted trinket given to you by the spirit that allows you to communicate with it. |
| 4    | You stumbled upon an ancient tome filled with long-lost healing knowledge. Obsessed with unlocking its secrets, you became a self-taught healer. Start with the mysterious tome and a journal filled with your own notes and experiments. |
| 5    | After suffering a terrible injury, you were healed by a reclusive healer who taught you their craft in exchange for your assistance. Once your training was complete, you were sent back into the world to continue their work. Start with a healer's kit and a recommendation letter from your mentor. |
| 6    | You were once a member of a traveling band of performers, using your healing abilities to treat the various injuries and ailments of your fellow entertainers. After a falling-out with the troupe, you struck out on your own. Start with a set of colorful clothes and a small musical instrument. |

| 1    | **Silver Needle**    | A gift from your mentor, this needle can be used to mend both physical and magical wounds. It never dulls or tarnishes and is imbued with a sense of purpose. |
| 2    | **Crystal Vial**     | This vial contains a single dose of a rare and powerful healing elixir. It is said to be able to cure any illness or injury, but it can only be used once. Be cautious when choosing to use it. |
| 3    | **Healing Stone**    | A small, smooth stone imbued with restorative magic. When held in your hand, it warms up and seems to pulse with energy. It can be used once per day to heal minor wounds. |
| 4    | **Herb Pouch**       | A beautifully crafted leather pouch filled with a variety of potent herbs. Each herb has its own unique properties, and the pouch seems to replenish itself every day. |
| 5    | **Ancient Amulet**   | A mysterious amulet that seems to hold great power. When worn, it grants you a sense of clarity and focus, allowing you to better understand the natural world and the forces that govern it. |
| 6    | **Blessed Bracelet** | A simple bracelet made from braided grass and adorned with a small charm. It was given to you by someone you helped, |


## If you are the oldest character in the party, your whole group is indebted to...

**The Wyldwood Covenant**: A powerful circle of druids and nature-worshipping beings who protect the balance of the land. They require you to complete a dangerous mission to cleanse a corrupted grove, which has become a breeding ground for twisted creatures. Failure to fulfill this task will result in the Covenant seeking retribution and potentially severing your connection to the natural world.
