As punishment it cursed you to feel the pain of others as if it were your own.

## Introduction
### The Provinces
- Large, settled regions under the control of a ruler. Regardless of the ruler, all lands are considered a part of **The Provinces**.
- The borders of **The Provinces** ebb and flow as rulers marry, conquer, and destroy one another. 
- 

### The Cobbles
- Any self-styled "center" of civilization within **The Provinces**. The people of **The Cobbles** are vast and sundry, reflecting the fulcrum of culture and education in **The Provinces**. 
- The local seat of power for whomever currently rules the surrounding lands, using their advanced technology, wealth, and might to bring the people of **The Field** and **The Wood** to heel whenever necessary. 
- To ensure the continued flow of food and goods, roads and footpaths are maintained and patrolled by soldiers, militia, and local champions.

### The Field
- Any farms, orchards, or meadows within **The Provinces** that owe a tax and tithe in exchange for cultivation "rights" over land and unprotected forests.
- The people of **The Field** are generally tougher folks from **The Cobbles**, and are equally as diverse. What they lack in education they make up for in practical skills, and their connection to the land and its natural history. 

### The Wood
- Any forested terrain within **The Provinces**. All forests are considered part of **The Wood**, no matter how isolated. 
- The people of **The Wood** are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to the rules of **The Wood**. And so, they are forever at war with **The Cobbles**. 

### The Marches
- Any lands beyond the boundary of **The Provinces** that lack a single monarch or ruler. 
- Typically wilder and less "civilized."
- People

### The Roots
- Remnants of the **Old World**, its labyrinthine hollows stretching for immeasurable distances deep underground, connecting the sewers of **The Cobbles** to the far-flung ruins of **The Marches**.
- Entrances to **The Roots** are scattered across **The Provinces**. These gates to the underworld are called **Gates**, and are usually protected or shrewdly hidden. 
- Only the brave or foolish have dared enter **The Roots**, in search of forgotten **Relics** or powerful **Spellbooks**. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures. 
- Folktales recount that travelling through **The Roots** bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries to the depths, only to emerge again claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others have claimed to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, travelling inthe tunnels beneath.
