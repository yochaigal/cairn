# Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems.  
Below are some tips that might help with the process!

## The Basics
Review the instructions in the [SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#creating-monsters). A couple of things to keep in mind:
- OSE (or B/X) has really great stat blocks that can be easily truncated for quick conversion. See this [page](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/General) and this [PDF](https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-adaptation-guidelines) for more.
- **HD** conversion is tricky! Start with a creature's **HP** _first_, _then_ convert their **STR**.
- Dungeon World has some great monster "moves" that translate to Critical Damage quite nicely, so looking for an equivalent creature in that system can really help! See this example [here](http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/5698559156420608).
- Sometimes a direct stat to stat translation isn't an option. That's OK! There is a [way](/resources/tools/converting-monsters/#use-the-fiction)!

### Health, Armor & Abilities
- **Hit Protection** is _not_ health. It's the creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill. If the PCs will have a tough time landing a blow that actually causes damage, the creature has high **HP**. A good rule of thumb is to give the creature +1 HP for every **HD**, on top of a minimum **3 HP** (the average person). I usually think of **HD** as equivalent to a d6, which has a _mean_ of 3.5.
- **Armor** is generally easy to map; phrases like "as leather" and "as plate" are really helpful. Generally ignore THAC0 and use descending AC (7 = Leather, 5 = Chainmail, 3 = Plate mail). If only ascending AC is given you can use (12 = Leather, 14 = Chainmail, 16 = Plate mail). Whichever system you're converting from, the Armor values range from 1-3.
- **Strength** is both health and physical power.  It also tracks constitution & resistance to poisons.  Look at the creature's **HD** and **HP** (even if you've already done so for **Hit Protection**). **STR** is the ability of a creature to survive a direct hit, not its ability to avoid danger! If a creature is difficult to kill but _not_ because they are good avoiding injury, give them more **STR** (_not_ more **HP**). A good rule of thumb is to compare them to the average person (10 **STR**) and go up or down from there.
- **Dexterity** is probably the easiest of the bunch. Start with **10** as a base and if the creature is particularly quick (sometimes called speed or SP), agile or nimble-fingered make it go up. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number.
- **Willpower** is tricky. It rarely comes up but when it does, it's nice to have. High **WIL** is strong personality, spirit or presence. **Morale** (**ML**) can be a good guidepost for **Willpower** as well. Morale typically ranges between 2-12; some games use a "Morale Check" is used to determine if a monster flees (in Cairn a **WIL** save is used instead). The referee rolls 2d6; if the result is higher than the monster's **ML** score, they flee.  

The following table offers a decent guide on converting **ML** to **WIL**.

|         |   |    |    |    |
|---------|---|----|----|----|
| **ML**  | 4 | 8  | 10 | 12 |
| **WIL** | 6 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

### Combat
- Attack **damage** is pretty straightforward coming from games like OSE (or B / X); you can usually just copy them as-is. Double-check with the [weapons table](/cairn-srd/#weapons) if unsure.
- Multiple attacks (e.g. 2 x claw, 1 x sting) typically convert to [_Blast_](/cairn-srd#Blast) and/or the "two weapons" rule (e.g. d6+d6 is roll 2d6, keep highest).
- When in doubt, think about how much serious damage the creature is supposed to do. Remember that instead of raising attack damage a step, think about making it _enhanced_ in certain situations or use the _Blast_ and "two weapons" rule.

### Abilities & Magic
- Sometimes the mechanics of the original system simply _do not translate_. That's OK; try to take what's cool about the creature and write a "version" of their ability more appropriate to Cairn.
- If the monster has an attack that asks the PCs to attempt to dodge or save against some ability, consider making the ability an out-of-combat "trap" that the PCs can trigger. Otherwise _make it succeed automatically_ during combat. The Warden can always telegraph the danger prior to combat to better prepare the PCs against the danger.
- Abilities can sometimes be made into weapons, and assign a damage die, making Critical Damage reveal the damage. More often you should simply let the ability or attack _happen_. Combat is dangerous, and it is up to the Warden to properly telegraph danger before the fighting begins.

### Magic
- Magical creatures can just "know" a bunch of spells. In this case, make their corpses magical (and dangerous)!
- Spells are tricky; you can give magic-users Spellbooks but remember, they might _drop_ them when defeated.
- I like to make 1d4 dropped Spellbooks implode ([Die of Fate](/cairn-srd#die-of-fate)), just to mix it up!

### Stat Block Structure
 There are many ways to do this, but try to be consistent! In Cairn I write it like this:
**Name**
X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, _qualities_), special items
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
- Special effect or critical damage consequence

## Use The Fiction
Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

Take for example this creature:

#### Foxwoman
Can take the form of a fox, a woman, or a 7' tall fox-headed.  
_HD 5, Speed 120', Armor 14, Morale 11, Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)_
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_**Using the example above, I can see that she:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Looking at the stats, it seems like she doesn't have too high HP, and she's quite fast.
- Her **ML** is pretty high. She's obviously quite willful.
- Agile and lithe.
- Attacks with deadly teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to metal weapons.

_**What can we learn from this?**_  
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. Starting from **3 HP**, then counting 1 **HP** per additional **HD** is **8 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. Normal human is 10 and she's bigger. **12 STR**.
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**.
- Her **ML** is high but not the max. And foxes are pretty cunning, right? She'll stick it out in a tough situation. **15 WIL**.
- I'd go with **bite (d6)** for the teeth attack, and **claws (d8+d8)**, the same as any two-handed weapon.

_**In summary, that leaves us with the following opening stat block:**_  
_8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)_

_**Now on to her abilities:**_  
This is pretty straightforward. We simply read the fictional stat block we created earlier!
- We know what she looks like, and that she can transform into a fox at will.
- She cannot be harmed by metal; I'm taking this to mean she's immune to _metal weapons_.
- She chokes her victims.

_**Easy, right? Now to make it useful:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on soon after.

_**And that's it!**_
_**Behold, a converted Cairn monster:**_

#### Foxwoman
_8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)_
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on soon after.
