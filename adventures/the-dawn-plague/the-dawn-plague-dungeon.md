## Multiple Entrances/Exits
- One entrance is beneath a rotating platform in the **Schul** (the pedestal)
- Another entrance via the **Orphan's Mound**

## Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

## Levels
- the **The Crown** (upper level), entrance from the **Schul**. Gradual descent from two different staircases
- Western staircase: the inner chamber (second level)
- Eastern Staircase: burial chamber (second level); has a vertical shaft leading from it and down into the outer chamber
- the outer chamber + tombs

## Have loops

## Have a lot of verticality

## Create secret areas/zones

## Variety in Room types

## Tactically useful areas

## Spying opportunities

_Emphasize putting the power in the player's hands to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact._

## ideas:
- Trap: an obvious painting on the ground/wall of whatever trap is behind it. Pressure tears the canvas, triggering the trap.
- Rooms: Sepirot stuff?
- False wells
- Head wires above tombs
- Powders that are inhaled
- Failed golems
- mercury addiction
