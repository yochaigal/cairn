|                  |                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Events Witnessed | Effects of Prolongued Viewing |
| **2** A Crowned King and his Wazir tour a natural crystal cave, the Wazir gestures and the King sneers. | Several vague ideas about crystal structure form occur to the viewer, providing "Training" in Tomb Crystal Faceting (see Appendix A). |
| **3** Workers toil at the edge of exhaustion. They carve a throne, and connect it to machinery they're installing in the walls and floors. | The workers look back, eyes filled with hate. Lith Mummies, Wights and Zombies are treated as if they rolled Hostile for their *Reaction* and seek to immediately kill the viewer. |
| **4** A Noble in battered armor kneels before a Crowned King. The King is angry. He grips the throne, and Burning Rays from the walls melt the Noble. | A curse of rage boils within, making the viewer yearn for brutal combat. Viewer will no longer use ranged weapons, and must make a WIL save to retreat from battle. |
| **5** A group of Nobles force one of their own into a gilded suit of red-hot armor. He screams, and pleads. A Sad Woman in chains watches. | Sympathetic magic burns and boils across the viewer. They take d6 STR damage in ugly blisters and rashes as they're cooked by the body's own fires. |
| **6** A Crowned King sits on the throne in the gilded chamber. Nobles and Concubines kneel before him, including a Sad Woman. | The viewer's manner changes. Sneering disregard and cold command come more naturally now. The viewer becomes imperious, with Reaction results reduced by one step for most social interactions. Hirelings treat their Reaction results as one step higher instead. |
| **7** A Crowned King slumps on his throne in the dark. He coughs blood into his sleeve, eyes wild. A Gilded Guard and silent concubines stand at his side. | The King's pain causes sympathetic lung disease. The viewer coughs and hacks when they're under stress, making stealth impossible until cured. |
| **8** A Sad Woman stares at the dying Crowned King. She smiles at the King's monsterous Gilded Guard, who nods back. | A sense of fufillment and the inevitability of revenge sets in the viwer's mind. Gain 1 WIL in steadiness of purpose. |
| **9** Incense, wailing and pomp as a Crowned King's corpse is placed on his throne. His weight arms the room's traps. | An understanding of the nature of traps within the tomb dawns on the viwer - they gain knowledge of the importance and use of the King's Mark (Areas 8 and 11). |
| **10** Concubines and Nobles drink poison from golden goblets and collapse into frothing heaps. A Sad Woman slips something from a vial into her cup. | Witnessing such foolish acts of devotion, and feeling sympathetic effects of the Empyrean poisons grants the viewer +1 STR due to an enhanced constitution. |
| **11** Draped in golden robes, a robed Wazir walks into the silent tomb. He seals the crystals behind him, and drinks from a poisoned cup. | A curse of compulsion to duty and truth seeps into the viewer. They are unable to lie without suffering internal bleeding (d6 STR damage per lie). |
| **12** A Crowned King —now the **Dead King**—mummifies on his throne. The corpse's weight keeps the machinery in the walls primed to trigger their Burning Rays. | Death's inevitability settles to ride the viewer's soul. Any attack that targets the viewer deals double damage if the maximum amount is rolled. |

### 4) Singing Crystals
* Crystal Columns: Crystals can be avoided by succeeding at a DEX save.  Failure results in d6 DEX damage from the painful warbling sounds produced, and failure to immediately leave the room as the sound intensifies will provoke a STR save, with failure leading to unconciousness and death by the end of the turn.
* Two Corpses: See **Empyrean Panoply** in **Appendix C**.  

### 5) Murkvey's Camp

* Crystal Plating: All attacks from normal weapons are *impaired*, unless the player specifically targets the face.

* Poisonous: Striking the Monstrosity creates a cloud of Tomb Crystal dust and a spray of crystal shards. After any combat where the Monstrosity has been attacked (damaged or not) anyone who was in the same location must make a STR save or suffer a level of Tomb Crystal Poisioning (see Appendix A). 
* **Critical Damage**: The Monstrosity inexorably crushes the victim, whose bloody remains are are absorbed into the Monstrosity's cancerous bulk.  It restores 6 STR and its attacks are treated as *enhanced* on its next turn.

### 7) Chambered Hall

#### Revenant of Greed
6 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 3 WIL, claws(d6)
* Shambling, Empyryean figures wrapped in stained silks, their hands compulsively grasping for any nearby riches.

## Appendix A - Occuliths

### Crystal Poisoning Infection Stage & Effect

|           |            |
| --------- | ---------- | 
| **Stage** | **Effect** |
| I | Bodily excretions turn to glittering pastel Tomb Crystal. Most notably, sweat will harden into fragile sheets, and tiny crystal tears must occasionally be picked out of one's eyes. **Suffer one Fatigue upon reaching this stage. No other negative effects**. | 
| II | Patches of crystal build up on bone, hair, and skin. They result in random bruises, stiff joints, and frequent aching pains.**-1 permanent DEX loss.** | 
| III | Eyes cloud and craze with tiny growths, while shoots of crystal push out through flesh. The poisoned character's immune system begins to break down. **-2 permanent loss to both STR and DEX.** | 
| IV | A crystal lattice thickens the blood. The heart pumps sluggishly, Crystals forming in the throat make eating and drinking difficult. Pain is constant at this stage, and sleep is never restful. **STR, DEX, and WIL all suffer 1d6 points of permanent loss. If any Ability Score is reduced below 3, the character is Deprived. Below 0, the victim dies, advances to stage VI, and rises as a Lith Wight**. | 
| V | Growths erupt through flesh as spires of Tomb Crystal grow all over the body. Pain becomes deadened at this stage as tiny crystal deposits in the brain dramatically decrease cognition, wit, and coordination. **DEX and WIL reduced to 3, maximum HP is halved, but the sufferer now heals 1 STR per turn as crystal growths replace their body's functions. If the character suffers Critical Damage at this stage, automatically advance them to Infection Stage VI.** | 
| VI | Entire limbs are now replaced with veined, blood filled Tomb Crystal. Death occurs, and the infected transforms into a Lith Wight. **The character becomes an NPC under the control of the Warden, but largely retains their strongest personality features and goals. They might remain with the party as a henchperson**. | 
| VII | Complete immobilization. Those limbs that are not transformed are completely encysted. The unfortunates who reach this stage lose any remaining vestige of identity. There is no cure at this point, only endless mineral pain. | 

### Occulith Size and Effect 

|          |          |          |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Name** | **Value** | **Effect** |
| Spark | 100 GP | Allows possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue, or restores 1 charge to a relic. |
| Ember | 500 GP | Allows the possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue, restore 2 charges to a relic, or enhance a spell quickly without consequence. |
| Carbuncle | 1000 GP | Allows the possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue and enhance it quickly without consequence, or restore 4 charges to a relic. |
| Orb | 10,000 GP | Allows the possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue and enhance it quickly without consequence, restore all charges to a relic, or perform a greater work of sorcery if given sufficient time and additional resources. 

## Appendix C - Wondrous Items

#### Blood Drinking Smallsword (d8)
* Anyone who fails a Critical Damage save as a result of a blow from the sword is *deprived* and all of their subsequent attacks are *impaired*. This lasts until the STR damage dealt by the weapon is healed. 

#### Crystal Executioner's Sword (d10+d10)
* Instantly kills a human-sized or smaller foe if two 10's are rolled for a single attack, or if an opponent fails their **Critical Damage** save. For a wielder with less than 15 STR, the sword merely does d10 damage and only instantly kills upon a failed **Critical Damage** save.

  **Recharge**: Unknown, but can be restored via Occulith. 

#### Mask of Command, 6 Charges
* The wearer can command fleeing allies (whether due to magical fear or failed Morale) to stand fast, allowing them to reroll their WIL save. Any NPC ally who succeeds must obey any commands issued by the wearer until the end of the current combat.  

#### Red Tome
* Special Note: The Red Tome is an object of Empyrean Sorcery that is far beyond the ken of more common Terrestrial sorcereries practiced by the denizens of the Crystal Frontier.  Thuvia's magical prowess is such that her versions of these spells are more potent and able to be performed in less time.  **The following spells are treated as Scrolls for the purposes of casting, and are used up in a similar manner.  The GP value listed next to each one is the price in magical materials and research that would be required to produce a terrestrial Spellbook capable of repeated use.**

* **Crystal Key (1000 GP)**: Can unlock any door with a keyhole.

* **Sand of Slumber (1000 GP)**: A target that you can see falls asleep. 

* **Scintillating Lamps (1000 GP)**: Creates an array of multicolored lights. Can be used to distract, or make vague shapes or patterns, but move slowly and provide poor illumination (as candle).

* **Illuminating Eye (1000 GP)**: One of the caster's eyes produces a bright light that is equivalent to a lantern. Can be directed at a single target to potentially induce blindness (WIL save or HP), but the PC directing the light is incapable of any other action.

* **Phantasmal Servant (1000 GP)**: Creates an immaterial entity capable of lifting, carrying, or manipulating one significant item.  Incapable of inflicting harm or of fine manipulation.

* **Crystal Weaving (2000 GP)**: A target in bowshot is bound with a web of crystalline strands. A successful STR save on their turn allows them to move freely once more.

* **Hallucinatory Miasma (2000 GP)**: Produces a small cloud cloud of gas (treat as a *blast* if used in a small, enclosed room) that causes paralysis via a cheerful languor. Target(s) who succeed at a WIL save may continue to attack, but all attacks are *impaired* and they are incapable of haste.

* **Mystic Prism (2000 GP)**: Creates an interdimensional space that the caster and up to four others can take refuge in.  Lasts until the Caster exits the space.

* **Fractal Presence (2000 GP)**: Produces several copies of the caster that seem to weave about in constant motion. Attacks against the caster are *impaired*.

* **Anathema (3000 GP)**: Permanently dispels an effect caused by a Spellbook or minor magical ability. Can temporarly nullify magical effects produced by magical objects or major magical abilities. 

* **Mirror Step (3000 GP)**: Step into a crystalline or reflective surface and exit through another surface in sight.

* **Crystal Storm (3000 GP)**: A blast of tiny Tomb Crystal particles scours the target, who must succeed at a DEX save or be blinded and suffer a level of Tomb Crystal Poisoning.

* **Madness of the Prisms (4000 GP)**: Up to 3 targets are beset by prisms of scintillating light that whisper unspeakable things to their victims.  Victims roll a 1d6 every turn of combat: **1-**Take no action, overwhelmed by stimuli from prisms. **2-**Attack nearest foe. **3-**Atack nearby ally. **4-**Attack nearest possible target. **5-**Attack self. **6-**May act normally.

* **Crystal Prison (4000 GP)**: target must succeed at a WIL save or be transformed into a statue of Tomb Crystal. The effect can be reversed with another use of the spell, or with an effect that negates magical effects.

* **Wall of Crystal (4000 GP)**: A straight wall of Tomb Crystal 50' long and 10' high rises from the ground. It is resistant to magic, heat, and cold, but is easily shattered by mining tools.  

* **Mirror Walk (5000 GP)**: Opens a portal in a reflective surface that connects to another reflective surface that has been seen by the caster.  Distance between the two points determines the potential consequences. 

*Journey Difficulty*

|          |          |          |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | WIL save or *deprived* | Journey is greater than the Local Dungeon or City map. |
| 2 | As above, plus 1 roll on the Journey Failure table | Journey is greater than the Regional Map |
| 3 | As above, plus 2 rolls on the Journey Failure table | Journey is greater than a Continent |
| 4 | As above, plus 3 rolls on the Journey Failure table | Journey is beyond the Terrestrial Sphere |

| 5 | **Refraction.** All treasure and valuables are transformed into worthless Tomb Crystal. |
| 6 | **Durance.** A random traveler is lost in the Place of Reflection, but may be recovered. |

* **Lithic Necromancy (5000 GP)**: Causes a growth of Tomb Crystal to bloom within a single corpse, transforming it into a [Lith Zombie.](/adventures/conversions/tomb-robbers-of-the-crystal-frontier/#Lith-Zombies) It will serve the caster until the next sunrise, after which it becomes an indiscriminate devourer of human flesh.

* **Phantasmal Hunter (6000 GP)**: Summons an invisible horror from another dimension that will relentlessly hunt and kill a single enemy.  It takes three hours to perform the ritual that completes this spell, and doing so leaves the caster *deprived*. The caster must make a WIL save at the end of that time, and failure means that the creature now has a second target before it returns to its realm: the caster.

**Phantasmal Hunter**
13 HP, 18 STR, 16 DEX, 18 WIL, claws (d12, *blast*), *detachment* 
* Phantasmal: Immune to non-magical weapon attacks and all missile weapons (barring the ability to see through invisibility).
