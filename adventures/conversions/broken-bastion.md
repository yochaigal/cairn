# Broken Bastion

- Converted from the [original work by Gus L./Ratking Productions](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/340122/Broken-Bastion).
- Converted by **Naeolin**

**War Automata**
18 HP, 3 Armor, 18 STR, 5 DEX, 18 WIL, pincers (d10+d10) and heat ray (d12, ignores armor)
* Magenta Shield: The Automata’s HP is derived from a translucent, glowing magenta orb that surrounds it at all times. It regenerates 2 HP per turn.
* Heat Ray: At the beginning of the Automata’s turn, it may target any character in sight with its heat ray.  
* **Critical Damage:** If dealt with pincers, roll a Die of Fate to determine what appendage is lost (4-6: arm or leg 1-3: head). If dealt with the heat ray, the victim's body and all non-magical equipment are reduced to cinders. 

**Lith Wights, Greater**
6 HP, 12 STR, 6 DEX, 15 WIL, rend (d6)
* Mad, rotting bodies heavily encrusted with Tomb Crystal that is shot through with greenish black veins.
* Crystalized Body: The wight is immune to damage from normal weapons. 
* Critical Damage: Suffer a level of Tomb Crystal Poisoning after the battle is over (see Appendix).

**Glass Spiders**
6 HP, 3 STR, 10 DEX, 6 WIL, bite (d6 poison damage)
* Will almost always attack, but will often retreat after one or more characters suffers Critical Damage.  They will return later with the intention of feasting on anyone left behind.
* Tenacious: Glass spiders do not check Morale (WIL save) unless reduced to 0 HP or faced with overwhelming force.  
* Critical Damage: target suffers from spasmodic violence and attacks (enhanced damage) the nearest creature, then falls into a coma. They die in 1d6/2 days, or recover in 2d6 if hydrated and cared for. 

### 3) Optics Station

Glass spiders that are undetected in this room will ambush characters, resulting in *enhanced* damage for the first round of combat.

### 8) Target Control

**Lith Wights, Armored Greater**
6 HP, 2 Armor 12 STR, 6 DEX, 15 WIL, rend (d6)
* Crystalized Body: The wight is immune to damage from normal weapons. 
* **Critical Damage**: Suffer a level of Tomb Crystal Poisoning after the battle is over (see Appendix). 

### 9) Command Center

Throne: Successful WIL Save or enter a state of shock for 1d6 Turns.

Crystal Orb: 1d6 STR damage unless some sort of magical protection is utilized.

### 12) Automata Control

**Maintenance Automata**
6 HP, 3 Armor, 12 STR, 15 DEX, 18 WIL, pincers (d8+d8)
* Mechanized Body: The automata's metal construction and mechanical nature ensures that all attacks with non-bludgeoning weapons are *impaired* and that it is immune to mind-influencing effects.

### 13) Mechanarium 

Gigantic Tanks: Anyone too close to a ruptured tank immediately takes 1d6 STR damage.  Those some distance away may make a DEX Save to make it to a place of safety in time.

 
## Appendix

**Commander's Emblem, 8 Charges**
* Unlocks all normal Empyrean doors with the expenditure of 1 charge. High security doors require a WIL save as well, and use 1d6 charges in the process.
* **Recharge**: Unknown. 

**Void Armor**
* As Chainmail (2 Armor), but also allows the wearer to operate in airless environments (for 12 Turns, if using Turn procedures).
* Wearers always act last during combat.

**Converter's Note**: With Gus's permission, I have added information on Tomb Crystal Poisoning and Occulith Size and Effect from *Tomb Robbers of the Crystal Frontier*.  


### Occulith Size and Effect 
|          |          |          |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Name** | **Value** | **Effect** |
| Spark | 100 GP | Allows possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue, or restores 1 charge to a relic. |
| Ember | 500 GP | Allows the possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue, restore 2 charges to a relic, or enhance a spell quickly without consequence. |
| Carbuncle | 1000 GP | Allows the possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue and enhance it quickly without consequence, or restore 4 charges to a relic. |
| Orb | 10,000 GP | Allows the possessor to cast a spell without adding Fatigue and enhance it quickly without consequence, restore all charges to a relic, or perform a greater work of sorcery if given sufficient time and additional resources. 

### Crystal Poisioning Infection Stage & Effect
|           |            |
| --------- | ---------- | 
| **Stage** | **Effect** |
| I | Bodily excretions turn to glittering pastel Tomb Crystal. Most notably, sweat will harden into fragile sheets, and tiny crystal tears must occasionally be picked out of one's eyes. **Suffer one Fatigue upon reaching this stage. No other negative effects**. | 
| II | Patches of crystal build up on bone, hair, and skin. They result in random bruises, stiff joints, and frequent aching pains.**-1 permanent DEX loss.** | 
| III | Eyes cloud and craze with tiny growths, while shoots of crystal push out through flesh. The poisoned character's immune system begins to break down. ** -2 permanent loss to both STR and DEX.** | 
| IV | A crystal lattice thickens the blood. The heart pumps sluggishly, Crystals forming in the throat make eating and drinking difficult. Pain is constant at this stage, and sleep is never restful. **STR, DEX, and WIL all suffer 1d6 points of permanent loss. If any Ability Score is reduced below 3, the character is Deprived. Below 0, the victim dies, advances to stage VI, and rises as a Lith Wight**. | 
| V | Growths erupt through flesh as spires of Tomb Crystal grow all over the body. Pain becomes deadened at this stage as tiny crystal deposits in the brain dramatically decrease cognition, wit, and coordination. **DEX and WIL reduced to 3, maximum HP is halved, but the sufferer now heals 1 STR per turn as crystal growths replace their body's functions. If the character suffers Critical Damage at this stage, automatically advance them to Infection Stage VI.** | 
| VI | Entire limbs are now replaced with veined, blood filled Tomb Crystal. Death occurs, and the infected transforms into a Lith Wight. **The character becomes an NPC under the control of the Warden, but largely retains their strongest personality features and goals. They might remain with the party as a henchperson**. | 
| VII | Complete immobilization. Those limbs that are not transformed are completely encysted. The unfortunates who reach this stage lose any remaining vestige of identity. There is no cure at this point, only endless mineral pain. |
