# Circle of Wolves

Original system-neutral [adventure](http://blog.trilemma.com/2014/07/the-circle-of-wolves.html) by Michael Prescott. Original conversion by [Jason Tocci](https://jasontocci.itch.io/agents-of-the-odd/devlog/180126/adapting-scenarios-for-agents-of-the-odd).  
Adapted with permission.

### Wolf spirit
12 STR, 12 DEX, 12 WIL, 6 HP, d8 bite
- If it deals you STR damage, it gives you a wolf mark that allows it to possess you.
- If it deals you critical damage, it tears off a limb.
- If it takes critical damage or drops to 0 STR, its host transforms back, and attackers have 1 round to finish the job with a silver weapon before it jumps to the next host.

### Vinteralf Warrior
5 HP, 1 Armor, 14 STR, 9 DEX, 8 WIL, axe or spear (d8)
- Highly resistant to cold.

### Vinteralf Confessor
3 HP, 11 STR, 8 DEX, 13 WIL, staff (d6+d6)
- Junior star-seers able to see three heartbeats into the future.
- Cannot be surprised: always goes before PCs on the first round.
