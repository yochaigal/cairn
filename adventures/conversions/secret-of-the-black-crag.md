# Secret of the Black Crag
- Based on the [original work](https://joelio1.itch.io/secret-of-the-black-crag) by [Chance Dudinack](https://wizardfightclub.blogspot.com/) and [Silverarm](https://silverarmpress.com/).
- Conversion by Louis Mesnier.

## General Notes
- If not mentioned, run as written.
- For naval travel, you can use Cairn 2E Wilderness Exploration procedures. It should work without changing much: just flavor the results to the maritime context. For pirate crews, use detachments. Ship combat is not really a focus of this adventure, but your players might expect it and ask for it. If so, hack your own rules, or use an existing Cairn / Into the Odd hack.
