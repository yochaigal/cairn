# What Child Is This?

- Based on the [original work](https://natetreme.itch.io/whatchild) by [Nate Treme](https://natetreme.itch.io).
- Conversion by [Dibson T Hoffweiler](https://www.dibson.net/) with contributions by Manny.

## General Notes
This document includes the prep I did to run **What Child Is This?**.  Most of it is probably statblock conversions.  But I'm also including what I'm calling a *remix*: some changes to the module and additional notes and mechanics.  You can ignore the remix section if you want, but maybe it would be fun or useful.

For conversion to Cairn, I have:
- **statblocks** for the module
- **watch distances** between locations (rather than hex distances)

The "remix" includes:
- **Tomb of the Owl Lord Remix** - new locations, descriptions, and other changes to the module's dungeon
- **The Baby Die Pool** - a mechanic to track baby's mood
- **Scenario hook questions** - to start the module

## Conversions
### Monsters and NPCs
My friend Manny came up with a bunch of these statblocks.  Included also are some notes about Manny's ideas for running certain monsters.

- Giant, poisonous.  Tracks victims with heat and smell.  Antitoxin can be made from their poison sacs.
- *Crit Damage*: Poisoned. Die within d12 hours unless cured. (The baby can cure this, esp if the poisoned PC was kind to the baby.)

#### Soldiers
**Manny's Suggestion**: The "Five Soldiers..." encounter refers to an undead king.  So use undead soldiers!

##### Wight
7HP, 2 Armor, 16 STR, 8 DEX, 12 WIL, longsword (d10)
- Indicate low dex: stiff, jerky, off balance
- *Crit Damage*: STR loss is permanent (baby can heal this)

#### Valzifak the Wizard
8 HP, 9 STR, 11 DEX, 16 WIL, dagger (d6)

**Manny's suggestions for spells**:
- Spells for a more puzzly encounter
	- *Fog cloud*: obscure an area, confuse targets
	- *Objectify*: turn into a common object, can be brought along with party
	- *Wizard mark*: with diamond dust and pigment, marks something

- Spells for wacky combat
	- *Magnetic spells*: Tether, repel, attract, push, pull
	- Make things fly with magnetism and kinetic force.  The rug can swoop around and maybe snatch the baby while this spells are taking effect.

#### Valzifak's Rug
4 HP, 8 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL, smother (d6)
- Magically animated.  Appears to be a normal rug, until it moves.
- *Wrap*: Incapacitates a target.  A wrapped target loses d4 STR at start of round.  When rug hit while wrapping a target, damage is split 50/50 between rug and wrapped target.

### Map Distances
The module suggests one encounter (essentially, one watch) per hex for travel.  Manny did that, and it worked great.  We played the whole module as a one-shot using that approach.

To practice working with Cairn wilderness procedures, I did a conversion to a point crawl.  **The travel times are the same on the road (1 watch per hex) but are longer when off-trail.**  It makes for a longer game because you will have more encounters.
- Holluck to Sultan's Oasis - 3 Watches
- Holluck to Cricket Forest - 3 Watches
- Holluck to Tomb of the Owl Lord - 4 Watches
- Sultan's Oasis to Tomb of the Owl Lord - 3 Watches
- Sultan's Oasis to Cricket Forest - 2 Watches
- Sultan's Oasis to Cortezia - 3 Watches
- Sultan's Oasis to Shepherd Camp - 3 Watches
- Cricket Forest to Cortezia - 2 Watches
- Cricket Forest to Shepherd Camp - 3 Watches
- Cortezia to Shepherd Camp - 2 Watches

**I tried to run the Cairn wilderness procedures for weather and getting lost, but it was a bit tough to take it all on.**  I think I wouldn't bother with those procedures if I were to run this module again because the encounters include most of the aspects of Cairn's wilderness procedure (dangerous encounters, discoveries, weather changes).

## Remix

### Locations - Tomb of the Owl Lord
The tomb in the module is a mostly linear dungeon crawl.  Inspired by the location generation procedure from _Mythic Bastionland_, **I added two rooms for flavor (Areas D0 and D3) and modified some connections between rooms.**  I also added some additional elements to rooms in the module (Areas 1-4) and some [Paint the Scene questions](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/paint-the-scene).

####  Remixed Map
Here's a weird ASCII map of the remixed tomb.

***

```
##### KEY

V   Secret Entrance
=== Clear Path
=/= Path with Obstacle
--- Secret Path
\   Indicates Path between levels
/   Indicates Path between levels

##### DUNGEON LAYOUT

                 \              /

                        \
                         =/= Area 4

```

***

#### Area D0 - Nest of Honor
*This is a room added for the remix.*
A cave filled with dry brush, that appears to be well tended.  Someone has tromped through recently, revealing a cave leading further into the mountain.  Etchings and paintings on the wall show great deeds of the Owl Lord.

*Paint the Scene*: Looking at the wall paintings, what scene or deed stands out to your character?

#### Area 1 - The Well
*These notes are in addition to, and modify some of the module's description.*

- Along the walls are six owl pellets the size of small barrels.  They can be cut open.  Three contain whole imp skeletons.  One contains an imp caught in a bear trap.  Another pellet has a bear trap in it.  Another has a bear trap with a key (this trap can trigger).
- Inside the stone well, just out of arms reach, is a pile of typical owl pellets and old dried mouse skeletons.  The contents are an illusion, and the well connects to Area 3.
- There's a door on the other side of the room, locked.  Key is in the pellet above.

#### Area 2 - The Gallery
*These notes are in addition to the module's description.*

A stand with a dusty closed book.  A corridor on the other side leads downwards. A stone door appears to be carved into the wall.
- When opened, the book begins to hoot, reading the book aloud.  The text is essentially a ledger, recording the lineage and deeds of the Owl Lord.  If written in, it can be used to communicate with owls.
- If the PCs use the baby or sign of the baby near the door, it will open to Area D3 - the Overlook.
- There can be a secret entrance/exit here, if characters search or get tipped off to one.  Perhaps behind a large portrait.

*Paint the Scene*: These paintings don't show the deeds of the Owl Lord, but the indulgences of his private life.  What do these paintings reveal that his devotees may prefer not to know?

*Manny's Note*: Ghost will opportunistically attack and possess a PC or NPC in order to sell the rug. Once the rug is sold, it will pass on to the next life. There's probably a really weird interaction you could do if it tries to possess the baby.

#### Area D3 - The Overlook
*This area is a new area added for the remix.*

From here, it's possible to see all of the Dune Sea.  To the city far off in the distance; the much nearer Oasis, the Cricket Forest abutting the mountain range, and humble village where your journey began.  More pellets are located here.
- The pellets contain 2 rations for each PC.
- This is a safe place to rest - the baby can keep it closed.
- Could have an encounter here: owl coming to anoint the remains of the dead in Area 3.

*Paint the Scene question*: Everywhere you've gone, there has been interest in this child.  This is a moment where the Dune Sea appears calm.  What soothing landscape or scenery are your eyes drawn to when overlooking the region?

#### Area 3 - The Anointed Hollows
*These notes are in addition to the module's description.*

Set into the walls are the remains of owls who served the Owl Lord.  Beaks, bones and claws rest in small piles of fresh pine needles.  Inside, a Cultist, Imp and Spined Devil argue whom among them is the most fiendish.  When PCs are spotted, trio agree the PCs are most fiendish.

#### Area 4 - The Sarcophagus
*These notes are in addition to the module's description.*

*Character-development Questions*: Have you looted a tomb before?  How do you feel about having looted the owl lord's sarcophagus?

### The Baby Die Pool
**I used a growing die pool to see if the baby gets upset.**  The die pool starts empty.  When I want to check if the baby is upset, add 1d6 and roll all the dice.  If there are any 1s, the baby gets agitated (triggers some troubling effect) and you empty the die pool.  GM's choice as to when to check.

**I would like to maybe come up with a few more negative effects the baby could have**.  The baby repeatedly crying and impairing everyone is good (players can even learn to manipulate the baby to turn the effect against enemies) but more options can spice things up.

### Scenario Hook
There's no significant hook in the adventure, which is totally fine if you're dropping this into a campaign.  The existing hook is straight forward, something like, a princess asks some adventurers to deliver a child to a distant city.  For a one- or two-shot, the GM can collaborate on a more specific hook with the players.

Consider telling player that **their characters are acolytes of a religious order**, and have them flesh it out with questions like these:

- What is core tenet of this religious order?
- What symbol represents this order to others?
- What brought you to join the order?
- What belief or aspect of the order challenges your personal belief system?
