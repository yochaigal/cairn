# Winter's Daughter

- Converted from the [original work by Gavin Norman](https://necroticgnome.com/products/dolmenwood-winters-daughter).
- In general, very little changes are necessary to run the adventure as written.

- This conversion was written for the original edition, _published with permission_.
- A PDF-friendly version of this conversion is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13gkybUAkRJAXSErB3rDXpclLOmpXLtOB).
