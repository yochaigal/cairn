Cairn is an [adventure game](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr) about a hardened adventurers exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics.
