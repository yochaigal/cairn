Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. The game was written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com). There are two editions (see sidebar) both of which are rules-compatible.
