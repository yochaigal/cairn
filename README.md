Cairn
=========================

Based on Knave by Ben Milton and Into The Odd by Chris McDowall, [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) is an attempt at making Into The Odd semi-compatible with popular OSR settings like Dolmenwood. Character generation is quick and random, classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics.

The PDF version is available for free on [Itch.io](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) & [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/330809/Cairn).  
For a list of resources, see the [Itch Community Page](https://itch.io/t/1094230/cairn-resources).

A print version of Cairn is now available! Pick it up at [Floating Chair](https://floatingchair.club/collections/zines/products/cairn) and [Spear Witch](https://spearwitch.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/cairn) in the US, [Monkey's Paw Games](https://monkeyspawgames.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/cairn) in Canada, and [Glaucus](https://gumroad.com/glaucus#ojuPK)​ in Australia.  
More storefronts to come soon (Exalted Funeral, Rook's Press, Soul Muppet).
