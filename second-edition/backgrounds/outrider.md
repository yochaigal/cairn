## What personal code or principle do you uphold? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **No innocent blood**: No bystander will come to harm on your watch. Take a **Steadymade Buckler** (+1 Armor). While holding this shield, you cannot be moved so long as both feet are planted on firm ground.                                                                         |
| **2** | **Revere the tools of death**: Weapons are to be respected and maintained. Take a **Wyrmbone Whetstone**. Following a half-hour ritual sharpening, attacks with the weapon are _enhanced_ until STR damage is dealt.                                                                  |
| **3** | **To the death, always**: You never back down from a fight, no matter the odds. Take a **Death-Whistle**, 1 charge. Its scream frightens away all who hear it (save WIL or flee). **Recharge**: Capture the final breath of a dying warrior.                                          |
| **4** | **Revere the dead**: Death is a journey we all take, and it deserves respect. Take an extra **30gp**. You always place two gold pieces on the eyelids of a slain foe. Somehow, you always find the coin.                                                                              |
| **5** | **Loyalty to the work**: Your word is your bond. Once you've accepted a job, you see it through to the end. Take a weathered **Tally Stick**. Once a vow is marked onto its face, the stick hardens (d8) until it is complete. The stick will snap in half if the vow is ever broken. |
| **6** | **Always pay your debts**: You always repay what you owe, whether in coin or in kind. You expect nothing less from all others. Take a **Blacked-Out Ledger**, then roll a second time on the **Bonds** table.                                                                         |
