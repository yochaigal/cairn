## What did you last hunt? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | A _mock firefly_, baiting water carriers with its glowing lure. Take an **Alchemical Limb** (d8, _petty_ when worn) to replace the one it tore off and an **Oil Can** (6 uses). The limb is immune to heat and poison. Needs to be oiled daily. |
| **2** | An _ice nettle_, trapping and draining sheep. You lost your commission when the fungus you introduced killed half the flock. Take a **Rime Seed** (1 use). It freezes any body of water, no matter the size. Don't eat it.                |
| **3** | A _silver marsh crawler_ that killed someone close to you. You now carry its **Tooth** (_petty_) on a chain around your neck as a warning to others of its kind. _The tooth hums softly when something is stalking you_.                  |
| **4** | A malicious _forest spirit_ that poisoned a homestead. You saved a **Heartseed** from the roots of a dying tree. (Plant it to create a new forest.) Also, take **Iron Bracers** (+1 Armor, _bulky_).                                        |
| **5** | A _hollow wolf_ that had been frightening travelers. You took pity on the half-starved creature and nursed it back to health. Now it is loyal to you unto death. It is also a great tunneler. 5 HP, 11 STR, 13 DEX, 8 WIL, teeth (d6).  |
| **6** | An _azure warbler_. The gametes attract a sizeable profit, if properly extracted. You succeeded but left its nest to the wolves. Take a **Paring Knife** (d6), **an extra 20gp**, and a pang of regret.                                  |                                                               |

## What tool is always in your pack? Roll 1d6:

|       |                       |                                                                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Fermented Spirits** | Keeps you warm at the best of times and as an explosive at the worst. 3 Uses.                       |
| **2** | **Trail Shaker**      | A noisy instrument that reveals nearby trails, even when deeply hidden.                             |
| **3** | **Drowse Balm**       | A wax bar. If boiled in water, the steam acts as a soporific agent.                                 |
| **4** | **Spike and Cord**    | For traversing difficult terrain or for creating makeshift traps and structures.      |
| **5** | **Iron Rattle**       | A noisemaker for distracting or scaring your quarry. Sounds convincingly like a snake.              |
| **6** | **Hardening Glue**    | Makes any flat material (cloth, leather, sand) as hard as stone. Expensive (20gp a bottle, 3 uses). |
