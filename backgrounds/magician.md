## You get

A pointed hat, a set of trick rings.

## Why did you quit magic?

1. **Prosecuted:** A series of witch hunters swore to have you drowned.
2. **Debt**: While performing a routine stage show, a being born from the shadows cast by your candles offered you power for your soul, mistaking it as a potential part of your act you obliged.
3. **Loss:** You mastered the ability to make things disappear, but you could never find where they went, eventually every pet you ever had was lost to the ether.
4. **Heckler**: One especially insensitive lay-about child always snuck into your shows and would shout just the worst jibes, to the enjoyment of your measly crowd.
5. **Sabotage:** Someone snuck into your storage and ruined your saw box, leading to your on-stage dismemberment of an audience participant.
6. **Thievery:** The look-alike you used for tricks stole your entire routine and has completely drawn your crowd away from you, painting you as the fraud.

## What trick was your specialty?

1. **Mentalism**: You have a significant chance of being able to guess a card drawn by another being from a deck in your control.
2. **Escapery**: A few classes of knots pose only a moderate threat to your freedom. You can also probably regurgitate a swallowed key or small item with repulsive frequency.
3. **Death Defiance**: Surviving being submerged for several minutes was something you routinely practiced, or at least you are able to suppress panicking before losing consciousness .
4. **Levitation:** Floating a stationary target weighing no more than 12 stones was a trick you received the least lukewarm applause for.
5. **Iron Jaws:** You've discovered the correct technique of eating glass and a variety of other traditionally inedible substances.
6. **Spiritualism:** With a bit of setup, smoke and mirrors, you have a very minor chance of convincing someone that a partner of yours is their deceased loved one.
