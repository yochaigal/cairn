# You Get

A dramatic outfit, a set of makeup, a withered rose.

# What was your final performance?

1. **Avant-garde:** You experimental one-person-show perplexed even the most diabolical coalition of warlocks who cursed you to never play again.
2. **Offensive:** The prince did not enjoy the laughter of the crowd responding to your musical accusations of his romantic failings.
3. **Injury:** The exotic beast seller promised you that your purchased owlbear was toothless. Turns out beaks are just as deadly.
4. **Maddening:** A travelling astronomer pitched you a sheet music inspired by vibrations they claimed to hear while looking into the night sky. Your fluting rendered the audience into a gibbering, howling state, rasping in fear and admiration of something called "the dwellers beyond the veil of space." Not exactly your theater's name so you didn't take it as praise.
5. **Timidity:** Your one and only performance involved you staring wide-eyed into the audience for several minutes. When you finally opened your mouth to speak your lines you were caught in anxiety-induced dry heaving. Everyone uncomfortable got up and just walked out.
6. **Cursed:** The various poems you recited mocked all variety of unnatural beings and their believers as delusional. A wayward godling found your atheism disquieting and cursed you to be a magnet for the supernatural.

# You made off with this trinket from your troupe:

1. **Simian Skull:** Sometimes confused for monster bones, this fanged skull smells faintly of exotic fruits.
2. **Massive Prop Weapon:** A gnarly blade resembling one of the many gods' weapons, much more intimidating until its revealed to be a wood-and-wool replica.
3. **Speculative Future Clothing:** A peculiar cotton t-shaped tunic, and rough blue trousers with a peculiar buckling apparatus near the front of the waist. This outfit is based on a fictional codex of time traveling serf to the far futures.
4. **Tome of Troubling Limericks:** These verses become less bawdy the further into the book you get, and become more and more harrowing.
5. **Many Faced Mask:** This leather and plaster mask appears mundane, but every time it is slipped off it takes the countenance of a random creature of legend.
6. **Stage Double:** Seeing as how you are out of work, your double also is. They continue to follow you day to day, but not without regularly complaining that you ruined their career.
