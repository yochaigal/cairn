# Green Slime
3 HP, 16 STR, 8 DEX, 6 WIL, acidic touch (d8+d8)
- Large blobs of green slime that stick to walls and ceiling. Attack by dropping on top of their victims.
- The acid corrodes both metal and wood along with the carrier, but cannot affect stone. Consumed flesh becomes more green slime.
- Immune to all damage except fire. Once stuck on a victim, can only be removed if burned away.
