# Character Creation

1. If you are creating a new party, define a cohesive group concept with the other players.
2. Roll or choose your [Background](#backgrounds). Use the tables on each background.
3. Roll your [Attributes](#attributes).
4. Roll your [Hit Protection](#hit-protection).
5. Roll or choose your [Bond](#bonds).
6. Take note of your [Burdens](#burdens).

## Backgrounds

Roll on each of the included tables from your background.

|         |                                                              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**   | [Scrapers](character-creation/backgrounds/scrapers.md)       |
| **2:4** | [Spitalian](character-creation/backgrounds/spitalians.md)    |
| **5:6** | [Anabaptists](character-creation/backgrounds/anabaptists.md) |

## Attributes

- Player Characters have just three Attributes: (**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**). 
- Roll ***2d6+3*** for each of your character's **Attributes**, in order. You may then swap any two of the results. 
- Attributes are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher. 

## Hit Protection

- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection (HP)**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long. See [Healing & Recovery](core-rules.md#Healing%20&%20Recovery). 
- If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the [Scars](core-rules.md#Scars) table.

## Bonds

Bonds tie you to someone else and the world.
Roll a ***d4*** and a ***d6***.
You may resolve your Bond, and will be awarded Growth.
Once resolved, you may roll a new Bond.
