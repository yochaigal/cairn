# What ended your run from the law?

|      |                  |                                                              |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Snitching**    | You reported on fellow scoundrels out-of-law. Your name was cleared, but you made a few enemies. |
| 2    | **Humiliated**   | You were captured, put into the stockades, and the whole town got a good laugh by throwing rotten food and eggs at you for a week. Now the urchins point and laugh, calling you Stinky Salad. |
| 3    | **Conscience**   | The first time you tried to grift or rob anything a small child looked at you in shame, you have since recanted your ways, fearing the gaze of the innocent. |
| 4    | **Remuneration** | You turned yourself in, and were fined everything you own. Routinely you witness the Baron's snotty son misusing your former prized possessions. |
| 5    | **Loophole**     | Turns out your crimes were not really crimes. You spent all the time living off the land, so you need to make the oncoming years count, and everyone feels a ton of pity for you. |
| 6    | **Betrayal**     | You strolled into the town and pinned and made a bold-faced lie that you were framed. Nobody really liked the miller who suffered the wrath of your pointed finger, but many say his daughter has declared revenge upon you. |

# What weird trinket did you stumble upon on your journeys?

|      |                                |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Eternal Hat**                | The hat you wear upon your head always produces a new hat underneath when you take the previous one off. Every hat is distasteful and out of style. You haven't figured out how to bare your head since putting the initial hat on. None of the removed hats retain this odd affect. |
| 2    | **Comedic Apple**              | This piece of fruit won't stop telling groan-worthy jokes and puns that barely work. You think your companions are going to eat it out of annoyance. |
| 3    | **A Very Stupid Parrot**       | This gorgeous bird is willing to follow commands, but always misinterprets them in astonishingly bad ways. |
| 4    | **Fireworks**                  | You stole a crate of very moldy fireworks off of a wagon. Somewhere less than half a dozen still function, although not predictably. |
| 5    | **Lasso of Fibs**              | When bound by this rope, the victim may not say anything that is true. |
| 6    | **Tin Can of Partial Message** | A single word may be shouted into this tin can, and then next time someone holds it up to their ear, they hear it. Its also very strict about compound words and you almost feel like its judging you when "strawberry" gets repeated as only "berry." |
