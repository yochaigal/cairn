## Why did you abandon your lands? Roll 1d6:

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**** |      |
| 2    |**** |      |
| 3    |**** |      |
| 4    |**** |      |
| 5    |**Overstepped** |      |
| 6    |**Vanquished**| You failed to protect your lands against a raging blight. Defeated, you left to find new ranges. Take a seed wrenched from the roots of your forest's final dying tree. It awaits the chance to be planted once more.|     

## What keepsake did you retain?

|      |                          |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Worm-Calling Whistle** | High-pitched whistle that attracts around a dozen earthworms, grubs, and other dirt-crawling beasts when blown. |
| 2    | **False Boomerang**      | This heavily-weathered boomerang not only does not return to you, but seems to travel unerringly in a straight line forever until it crashes into something. You've been worried you're going to lose it if you throw it towards the sky. |
| 3    | **Bear Suit**            | The entire furs of a person-sized bear, treated and stitched to be wearable. Its a bit hard to see out of the beast's snout, but not the worst disguise from afar. On a foggy day. While situated amongst the brush. When trying to hide from someone with poor vision. |
| 4    | **Game Spookers**        | A very weighty round brass bell. Toss into a bush to scare out any game, or to dangle upon your walking stick to give yourself your own entrance music. |
| 5    | **Snare Kit**            | A heavy canvas sack filled with all manner of traps - iron teeth, lassos, ropes, nets, counter weights, snares, etc. |
| 6    | **Salts & Spices**       | A very fine wooden box filled with tubes and pouches of uncommon spices, treating salts, fancy woods. Suitable for preserving small game or adding a bit of pizazz to a campfire meal. |
