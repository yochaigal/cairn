## Why did you abandon the hunt? Roll 1d6:

|      |                   |                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Empathy** | Tracking and killing your quarry in new territory, you unwillingly enraged a local spirit. Enraged, it cursed you with the ability to experience the fear of any nearby creature. You are now an excellent tracker, but cannot bring yourself to hunt. |
| 2    | **Betrayal**  | You privately confronted a respected elder about their misdeeds and were rudely dismissed. After nearly losing your head to a crossbow bolt, you broke all ties and fled. Before you left you grabbed the elder's prized talisman (_Ward_ once per day). They want it back.|
| 3    | **Remorse**  | You neglected your duties during the _Great Hunt_, and an important person was killed as a result. Ashamed you left the life you knew, taking a Thundering Horn as a reminder of your dereliction in duty. |
| 4    | **Instincts** | Even as a child you had dreams of the city and its fascinating denizens. When you became of age, that's where you went. You still hunt however; the prey is just different. Take a poison-tipped spear (d8+d8) and a bottle of poison (d6 STR damage).  |
| 5    | **Self-interest** | |
| 6    | **Conviction** | After a close-call with a Horror of the Night, you were instilled with conviction.  You have adopted a strict code of ethics to only kill that which eats people, and to never eat flesh again. You became a slayer of monsters, wandering towards wherever you feel you are needed. Take a Silver Sword (d8). The damage is (d8+d8) against creatures that have tasted the flesh of your kind. |

## What time of day do you typically hunt?

|      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    |**Dawn** | You're most alert at first light, and rarely require breakfast. You do not become deprived after missing a single day's rations. If you haven't eaten by the second day you gain both days' Fatigue.|
| 2    |**Morning** | You know the calls of birds and how to bend them to your will. Take a young falcon (3 HP, 3 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, claws (d6), follows simple whistle commands) Occasionally it bites you. |
| 3    |**Day** | You are a skilled rider. Attacks against unmounted combatants are enhanced so long as you are on a horse. Take an old nag from the plains (+2 slots, fast enough). |
| 4   |**Afternoon** | You learned to hunt alongside dogs, tracking your prey by smell, spoor, and blood. Your scent-hound (2 HP, 5 STR, 13 DEX, 8 WIL, bite (d6), loyal to a fault) is never far from you, and responds to even the most subtle cues.|
| 5    |**Dusk** | Your quarry typically lived in trees and dense forests. As a result you are an excellent climber, and know the behavior of most arboreal creatures. Take a bird whistle.  |
| 6    |**Midnight** |For years you stalked large deer and elk through tundra and forest, never staying in one place for more than a few hours. You don't need as much sleep as most; once per day you can lose a single Fatigue without having to rest. You always sleep with one eye open.  |
