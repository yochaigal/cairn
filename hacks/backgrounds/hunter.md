## Why did you leave the hunting grounds? Roll 1d6:
|      |                   |                                                              |

| 1    | **Cursed**            | A gigantic blue elk with golden glowing eyes approached as you took your final catch, promising to hunt you to the end of your days if you stepped foot into its forest again. |
| 2    | **Hunting Accident**  | Your younger sibling would invite you hunting every time your parent spoke of passing down the family's wealth onto you. You got the message with the last crossbow bolt that narrowly missed your head, and have disclaimed your inheritance. |
| 3    | **Broken Heart**      | After your old blood hound couldn't follow you on any more hunts, you felt it wasn't |
| 4    | **Nobles**            | All of the lords decried the forests of the land their own person domain, forbidding any others to hunt within, putting you out of a job. |
| 5    | **Wizard's Laughter** | You didn't mean to kill the village's most-loved and kindest-hearted wizened old sage. You had no idea they polymorphed themselves into wildlife to go frolic in the woods. |
| 6    | **Haunting**          | The dooming blight that has choked many lands has reached your ranges, littering the once peaceful groves with hungry ghosts. |


## What keepsake did you retain?

|      |                          |                                                              |

| 1    | **Worm-Calling Whistle** | High-pitched whistle that attracts around a dozen earthworms, grubs, and other dirt-crawling beasts when blown. |
| 2    | **False Boomerang**      | This heavily-weathered boomerang not only does not return to you, but seems to travel unerringly in a straight line forever until it crashes into something. You've been worried you're going to lose it if you throw it towards the sky. |
| 3    | **Bear Suit**            | The entire furs of a person-sized bear, treated and stitched to be wearable. Its a bit hard to see out of the beast's snout, but not the worst disguise from afar. On a foggy day. While situated amongst the brush. When trying to hide from someone with poor vision. |
| 4    | **Game Spookers**        | A very weighty round brass bell. Toss into a bush to scare out any game, or to dangle upon your walking stick to give yourself your own entrance music. |
| 5    | **Snare Kit**            | A heavy canvas sack filled with all manner of traps - iron teeth, lassos, ropes, nets, counter weights, snares, etc. |
| 6    | **Salts & Spices**       | A very fine wooden box filled with tubes and pouches of uncommon spices, treating salts, fancy woods. Suitable for preserving small game or adding a bit of pizazz to a campfire meal. |
