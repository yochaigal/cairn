## Why Did You Stop Practicing Alchemy? [Roll 1d6]

||                 ||
| ---- | ---- |----|
|1|**Lack of Talent**| The most advanced concoction you could come up with was salt water. You are still pretty good at it, actually.|
|2|**Heresy**| Local clergy found your theories and practices to be blasphemous and confiscated your works. Creatures of the Night will briefly look upon you as brethren.|
|3|**Exiled**| You accidentally brewed a love potion for a client, an heir to a local position of nobility. They are now in infatuated by you, and their parents would rather see you dead than their offspring end up with you. You are hunted by both your client and an assassin. You have gotten good at disguising yourself.|
|4|**Hunted**| Somehow you created a homunculus, a small 6-inch replica of yourself. It hates being enthralled to you and though it will follow your commands to the letter, it will try to undo your requests whenever possible.|
|5|**Betrayed**| You're pretty sure your mentor was slowly killing you with arsenic. Every once in a while you'll find yourself in a vomiting fit. You are rarely hungry any more and require rations only every 2 days.|
|6|**Accident**| The last concoction you brewed resulted in a massive explosion, scarring you horribly. Most folk will look away from whatever you're up to. You can walk handle fire for small spurts without taking injury.|

|1|**Alchemist's Fire**|A clay bottle filled with sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air. Counts a bottle of burning oil without needing to lit.|
|2|**Bomb**|Head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder with an attached wick. Deals d12 [blast](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#blast) damage.|
|3|**Vial of Acid**|Can disintegrate 1 cubic inch of any surface.|
|4|**Tincture Of Truth-Talking**|Only a few drops remain, enough for one dose. This tasteless clear liquid will compel whoever ingests it to answer questions truthfully for d6 \* 10 minutes.|
|5|**Magnesium Shavings**|A pouch containing d6 uses that will easily ignite and burn intensely.|
|6|**Basic Alchemist's Kit**|A wooden chest filled with four corked glass vials and stand, a small bronze weight scale, pestle & mortar, stirring rods, a bottle of solvent, and a pouch of salt.|
