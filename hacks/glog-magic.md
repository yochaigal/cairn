# GLOG Magic Hack
---
To use [GLOG Magic](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html) spells in Cairn, consider the following player rules:
- You carry a **Grimoire** worth 300gp. It is [bulky](cairn-srd/#inventory), and contains a single [random spell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTVy-5Vm44xhRmFO4tKFCJto-_cw0xYtD8lNj8AsSJY/view?pli=1).
- You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to available [inventory slots](cairn-srd/#inventory).
- Treat all Spellbooks as [Scrolls](/hacks/glog-magic/#scrolls).
- If you get doubles of any kind, something has gone very wrong. Roll 1d6 on the [**Mishaps**](https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/glog-magic/#mishaps-sum-of-doubles-rolled) table and add whichever double was rolled. If there are multiple doubles choose the lowest.

**Note:**  
These rules are _not_ intended as "drop-in" toolbox for casting GLOG spells. Most spells in Cairn are simply tools.

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote the spell's duration with **D** and range with **R**.
2. Choose how many **MD** you want to invest into the spell. Spells will refer to these as [dice]. Some spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. A die that shows a result of 4-6 is removed from play and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

### **Example**
_**Barry** has 4 free inventory slots, giving him 4 **MD**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image** (see below), and decides to invest 3 of his **MD**. That means he can create three duplicates that last for three minutes each. He rolls: a double 2s and a 5. He gains one **Fatigue**, and 2 **MD** returns to his pool, with **1** remaining. However, he also rolled doubles, meaning that he must roll on the [**Mishaps**](https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/glog-magic/#mishaps-sum-of-doubles-rolled) table as well. He rolls 1d6 and adds 2 from the double rolled to the result._

### [ **Mirror Images** ]

|                            ||
| ---------------------------||
| D: [dice] minutes | R: self |

_Creates [dice] duplicates of you, which overlap with you and confuse attackers. Any time you’re attacked, the attack has an equal chance to hit you or any of your images. If an image is hit, it is destroyed._

## Advanced Rules

### **Scrolls**
- Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after a single use. Otherwise, they work exactly the same as spells recorded in your **Grimoire**.

### **Copying Spells**
- You may copy spells found in Scrolls to your **Grimoire**.
- It costs 50gp for the gold inks and takes 6 hours to complete, reduced by [sum] hours.
- The Scroll is destroyed in the process.

### **Creating a Grimoire**
Creating a **Grimoire** is time-consuming and expensive. You will need:
- A single Scroll, which is sacrificed through the process.
- 200gp in inks, as well as a blank book.
- 6 hours in the light of a full moon. You can invest reduced by [sum] hours.
- The spell contained within the Scroll becomes the first recorded spell.

#### Mishaps (roll 1d6 and add lowest double rolled)

||                 |
| ---- | ---- |
|1|**MD** only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours.|
|2|You cannot cast spells for 1d6 hours. |
|3|Gain an extra Fatigue from the results of the spell cast.|
|4|You lose the ability to cast spells for 24 hours.|
|5|The Spell's effects are reversed; the Warden will tell you how. |
|6|You are [deprived](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#rules). After recovery, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.|
|7|You take 1d4 **WIL** damage when casting spells for the next 24 hours. Afterwards roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.|
|8 |Your **Grimoire** is damaged and unusable. Creating a new **Grimoire** from its remains restores the original spells as well.|
|9 |You become insubstantial for 1d4 hours as your spirit leaves your body, which remains unconscious. You can fly and pass through walls, but not touch anything. Also, no one can see or hear you through mundane means.|
|10 |You suffer horrible arcane burns; lose 1d4 WIL. From now on you can add +1 **MD** to a spell's [dice]; on a result of 4-6 you lose 1 **WIL**.|
|11 |The spell backfires; you lose 1 inventory slot (scratch it off your sheet). You are now surrounded by a magical essence that provides +1 Armor (limits still apply).|
|12 |Arcane energies wrack your body as a piece of your soul is transferred into your **Grimoire**. You lose half your WIL (rounded down). Your **Grimoire** now appears in any form you wish and takes no space in inventory. It cannot be destroyed except by your own death.|
