# GLOG Magic Hack
---
To use [GLOG Magic](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html) rules in Cairn, consider the following player rules:
- You carry a **Grimoire** worth 300gp. It is [bulky](cairn-srd/#inventory), and contains a single random spell.
- You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to available [inventory slots](cairn-srd/#inventory).
- See this [**list of GLOG Spells**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTVy-5Vm44xhRmFO4tKFCJto-_cw0xYtD8lNj8AsSJY/view?pli=1).
- Treat all Spellbooks as [Scrolls](/hacks/glog-magic/#scrolls).

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote the spell's duration with **D** and range with **R**.
2. Choose how many **MD** you want to invest into the spell. Spells will refer to these as [dice]. Some spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. Any that show 1-3 return to your **Casting Pool** for future spell  Any that show a 4-6 are removed from play, and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

### **Example**
_**Barry** has 4 free inventory slots, giving him 4 **MD**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image** (see below), and decides to invest 2 of his **MD**. That means he can create two duplicates that last for two minutes. He rolls: a 2 and a 5. He gains one **Fatigue**, and 1 **MD** returns to his pool, with **3** remaining._

### [ **Mirror Images** ]

|                                 ||
| ------------------------------- ||
| D: [dice] minutes | R: Self |

_Creates [dice] duplicates of you, which overlap with you and confuse attackers. Any time you’re attacked, the attack has an equal chance to hit you or any of your images. If an image is hit, it is destroyed._

### Advanced Rules

#### **Scrolls**
Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after a single use. Otherwise, they work exactly the same as spells recorded in your **Grimoire**.

#### **Copying Spells**
You may copy spells found in Scrolls to your **Grimoire**. This costs 50gp for the gold inks and takes 6 hours to complete, reduced by [sum] hours. The Scroll is destroyed in the process.

#### **Creating a Grimoire**
Creating a **Grimoire** is time-consuming and expensive. You will need:
- A single Scroll, which is sacrificed through the process.
- 200gp in inks, as well as a blank book.
- 6 hours in the light of a full moon.
- The spell contained within the Scroll will become the first recorded spell.
