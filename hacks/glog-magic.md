# GLOG Magic Hack
---

- You carry a **Grimoire**, which is [bulky](cairn-srd/#inventory).
- You have a number of **Magic Dice** equal to available inventory slots. This is referred to as your **Casting Pool**.
- See this [**list of GLOG Spells**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OTVy-5Vm44xhRmFO4tKFCJto-_cw0xYtD8lNj8AsSJY/view?pli=1).

### Casting Spells:
1. Pick a spell from your **Grimoire**. They may denote range with **R** and duration with **D**.
2. Choose how many **MD** from your **Casting Pool** you want to invest into the spell. The number of dice will be referenced with [dice]. Certain Spells will refer to the sum of the dice with [sum].
3. Roll [dice]. Any that show 1-3 return to your **Casting Pool** for future spell  Any that show a 4-6 are removed from play, and you gain one [**Fatigue**](/cairn-srd/#rules) for each.

#### **Spellbooks**
You may copy spells found in Spellbooks to this **Grimoire**. This costs 50gp for the gold inks and destroys the Spellbook in the process.

#### **Scrolls**
Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after use. You may invest magic dice to enhance the spell.

#### **Example**
_**Barry** has 4 free inventory slots, giving him 4 **MD**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image** (see below), and decides to invest 2 of his **MD**. That means he can create two duplicates that last for two minutes. He rolls: a 2 and a 5. He gains one **Fatigue**, and 1 **MD** returns to his pool, with **3** remaining._

### [ **Mirror Images** ]

| D: [dice] minutes | R: Self |

Creates [dice] duplicates of you, which overlap with you and confuse attackers. Any time you’re attacked, the attack has an equal chance to hit you or any of your images. If an image is hit, it is destroyed.
